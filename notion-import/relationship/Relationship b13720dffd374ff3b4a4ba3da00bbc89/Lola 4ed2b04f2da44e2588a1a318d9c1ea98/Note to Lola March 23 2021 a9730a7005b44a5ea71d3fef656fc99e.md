# Note to Lola March 23 2021

i'm always trying to better myself, and this is only an attempt at that; so I can be better for you.

My love.

The last thing I ever want is for something that makes either of us uncomfortable to go unspoken or unaddressed and end up getting expressed passive aggressively; in my experience, for awhile.

You and I have different tastes and preferences for a variety of things, from food to friends. That said, I love you all the same.

I'm bringing this up, as yesterday you expressed a pretty strong disgust for my song Woman of Mine, claiming that a number of qualities about the music and lyrics are awful.

I promise you that in no way am I offended by this. I respect your opinion, and value you being honest with me very much - even when it's highly critical.

You know that I'm pretty harsh on myself, as well. That said, I personally feel that it's one of the best songs I've written; definitely not musically, but lyrically.

The reason that I bring this up is to ask you whether that song makes you uncomfortable because it is about a difficult moment in my past marriage. If so, it's something I'd be glad to talk with you about and listen to how it makes you feel.

Otherwise, I'll simply accept it as you not liking a specific piece of art I made.

I love you.
