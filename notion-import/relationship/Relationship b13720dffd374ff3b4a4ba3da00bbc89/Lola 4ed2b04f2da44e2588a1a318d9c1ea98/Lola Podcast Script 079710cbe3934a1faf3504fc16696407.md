# Lola Podcast Script

My Dear Lola

I think that there's been some elephants in the room and we owe it to each other to start naming them. To get the ball rolling, I know that you like listening to podcasts while working - so I thought, why don't I record you a podcast.

A quick aside, I responded lightheartedly to you message about our Spain trip because, when all was said and done, I felt that the trip was a success. From my own perspective, I:

- Got to learn more about you and where you're from.
- I improved your father's opinion of me, which by all indicators seems a true feat!
- I met and, believe, was liked by several of your old friends.
- I met and formed a great friendship with Isa and Santi, who I thought were awesome.
- And I got to take many walks, eat many meals, and have many conversations with the most important person in my life; you!

All of the other stuff, I don't really care all that much about or associate much importance with. That's why I've been caught off guard by how sad and frustrated you feel about how the trip went.

However, it's taken me a few days to see - hopefully correctly - how this trip for you had become symbolic of some much larger and much more important questions about "us".  Like I mentioned while we were in the apartment, I  sensed a tsunami coming as soon as I landed in Spain and not until now do I think I understand what's happening.

You mean the world to me, so I wanted to make sure that I found words from my heart with time rather than from my brain in the moment. Additionally, I've learned that when it comes to thinking about love and family, that big brain of yours has a persistent tendency towards running you up and down the flagpole about 1000-times to exhaustion. Therefore, I really hope that my words help you love yourself and love us a little more during, what I sense is, a really hard time for you.

Chapter 1: Wants.

It's scary to talk to the people you love about the things you want. Especially, when you are unsure of whether they do or don't want the same. I'm talking about big wants. Wants like  "do you want us to have a future?", "do you want us to live together?", "where do you want us to live?", "do you want us to get married one day?", "do you want us to have kids one day?"... I'm sure you have a track-full of other on-point examples playing bumper-cars in your brain right now, so I'll stop there.

Just the thought of trying to talk about these types of wants can induce panic and goose bumps. They're very scary, very uncomfortable, and the conversations that ensue have the potential of being the beginning of the end, or the end, in even the strongest relationships; ones that both people have put so much effort into. Plus, the idea that "if it's meant to be everything will just work out" is an amazing scapegoat that allows us to think we've transcended the minutia and have surrendered to the unknown.

So why even bring them up?

Unfortunately, there's no one who's disciplined enough to actually just "let go" and see where love takes them. Especially when it comes to two people that genuinely love each other; people like us. Instead, when our wants come up, we torture ourselves endlessly trying to hide them or answer them indirectly.

Here are the steps for how I think we do it.

Steps:

1) A really important want percolates up into our brain that involves the person we love and we can't get it out of there; whether it's ourselves, our family, or our friends who catapulted it front and center.

2) We work really hard at rationalizing it and end up – temporarily – convincing ourselves that it can wait or we can handle it or figure it out on our own.

3) Without realizing it, we begin to associate random and unconnected things in our lives as being related, relevant, or symbolic to that "want". We create and associate unwarranted meaning with unconnected moments, conversions, and interactions, because we can most easily manipulate those to seem to mean whatever we want; they're practically blank canvases.

4) We build tall walls of emotions and imagined conversations between the person we love and ourselves. Creating distance, loneliness, and uncertainty for both - making everything feel fragile, lost, and hopeless.

5) Then, one day, it all comes crumbling down. At that point, the scary conversation finally happens. The one that was so desperately attempted to be avoided. However, sadly, it's then happening at a point where many layers of resentment, confusion, falsehoods, accusations, anger, guilt, and embarrassment need to be delayered to get back to where it all started; which usually was something like this:

"I love you very much and because of that I'm really scared to bring this up. However, it's really important to me so I'd like to talk about it. I've been thinking a lot about ________. I want __________ for us. What do you want?"

Personally, I believe that most people have lived only ever discussing really important things after running through the steps above. Which is why, I also believe, most people hate having direct and important conversations with loved-ones so much; you being one of them. In past relationships of my own, I did as well.

Now with that all laid out, I hope you better understand why I'm usually so eager to talk about the "hard-stuff". It's not at all because I enjoy those conversations – trust me, I don't – it's because I believe doing so in a timely manner is the only way of avoiding steps 1 through 5. Bottling it up, focusing on something else, creating a different and less meaningful thing to obsess over, and all the other strategies simply don't work. So, avoiding steps 1 through 5 is always my #1 priority with people I love and care about.

Put simply, both suck, but one is way worse!

Chapter 2: Demographics

Statistics, data, probabilities and the like are all evaluation tools that help intelligent minds feel insightful. They are incredibly useful for decision making when those decisions must consider a population of subjects - people subjects, animal subjects, and whatever subjects. The reason being because no one will ever have, or afford, the time to get to know each of those subjects individually - so instead they have to generalize. And from those generalizations they can make, hopefully, the most accurate decisions and predictions with very limited information and context.

Unfortunately, applying those same tools to understanding deep interpersonal relationships, as well as ourselves, simply doesn't work. Here's an example;

- Lola Sanchez is a woman in her early 30's who's a pet owner.
- Sebastian Scholl is a man is his late 20's who plays music.

These demographics are definitely something Unilever might want to know so they can optimize which products they target at us. However, these demographics are definitely not something that either of us should rely on, or prioritize, when trying to understand one another. All doing so accomplishes is de-personalizing, and even the de-humanizing, a deeply personal and connected relationship.

Lola Sanchez, a woman in her early 30's that's a pet owner, does not in anyway describe who Lola Sanchez is to me. To me, Lola Sanchez is someone who I love and care about. She's someone who when I can sense is sad, I don't sleep well and want to help her. She's someone who when I sense is happy, I feel confident and relaxed. She's someone who when she wants something, I want help her get or accomplish it. She's someone whose wants I consider when I consider my own. She's someone whose feelings, dreams, and desires I consider when I consider my own. She's the person I feel accountable to and want to have her respect me.

There's a billion+ woman in there early 30's that are pet owners, but to me there's only one Lola Sanchez. If I ever wanted or needed to know what Lola wants or believes - no matter how uncomfortable the question or answer might make me - I'd never, ever substitute asking her with "___________ is what most women in their early 30s who own pets want or believe." Instead, I'd respect her as an individual, ask, and listen.

Because of all of that, I don't like to ever avoid an uncomfortable conversation with someone I love by way of rationalizations like, "she's just a women", "he's just a 25 year old", or "she's just a mom." Trying to reduce everything you know, love, hate, respect, and feel about someone down to several impersonal demographics is disingenuous to oneself and ones friend, family, or partner.

Unfortunately, most of the advice we get from friends and family about relationships is just that. Demographic based generalizations. It makes sense. They really don't know "us", and even the ones that know both people separately can rarely fathom what makes the relationship work, or not work. This is why they must base their advice off the superficial generalizations, like "he's/she probably does/doesn't want ___________ because they're [insert demographic here]."

For the individuals were fortunate enough to know intimately, the greatest respect we can give them is evaluating them as individuals.

Chapter 3: Decisions

The last two chapters, I hope, properly set the stage for this chapter; decisions.

It would be so wonderful if others could make our decisions for us. Or, maybe even better, if factors beyond anyone's control forced our decisions. It's very, very hard to confidently say "I've decided __________, because that's what I want. [full stop]" So instead, we scour for and create reasons that, hopefully, justify us putting some resemblance of a flag in the ground.

However, that approach too often fails us.

When it comes to matters of the heart, reasons are rarely relevant or even related! Relationships are the most mysterious of chemical cocktails which leave no reason or rhyme to how they're concocted. Instead, decisions like "I love this person", "I want to live with this person", "I want to marry this person", "I want to have kids with this person", and " l want to grow old with this person" have to be felt - not justified or reasoned. As soon as we look for justifications or reasons, we're no longer listening to ourselves.

However, that still doesn't make decisions easy - they're fucking horrifying! To go with your gut instinct on major life decisions and vocalize them to someone you love, when you don't even know whether they'll accept you or reject you...no fun at all. That said, I believe, the alternative is wayyy worse. The alternative being, knowing what you want but not admitting it, then trying to justify or reason with it, and then trying to change it based on something someone said or some externalities you think are important, and then ignoring it, and then feeling down, and all in all just driving yourself crazy.

Like wants in chapter 1; both suck, but one is way worse! And like demographics in chapter 2; using generalizations to justify your personal and interpersonal decisions is disengenuous to oneself, as well as ones partner.

Chapter 4: Sebastian

I'm going to talk about myself for a little and, by doing so, communicate to you some wants and decisions of mine that - I suspect - you've been driving yourself crazy trying to discern by both my demographics and our Spain trip as being tell-tale...

So, here goes that!

First off, I'm a slow thinker. I've learned from experience that the opinions I form in the moment contain about 1% the intelligence of those I form after reflection - and I don't like saying one thing today and another thing one-week later; my words are really important to me. So, I try to avoid being too opinionated or declarative in the moment, especially when it comes to new experiences! Statements like "I loved it", "I hated it", "it was amazing" and the like are ones that I'm very careful with. And I'm very aware of what a silent discontent that makes me look like! That said, I'm really not one. There's many things I love, experiences I love, and moments I love - I'm just most comfortable when I have time to form those feelings and understand what they mean to me.

At the risk of sounding woo woo, I believe that there are three souls in every relationship. They are you, me, and us. Each of them have their own wants and at different points must make decisions. You and me will, and probably should, always be somewhat selfish. Us, on the other hand, is it's own bundle of hopes and dreams that you and me must create together. We must communicate and collaborate to create us. The starting point of which is being honest and open about our individual wants.

I'll start with some of the big ones that I've sensed are relevant to share, coming from Me:

1. Do I want a relationship?

Yes. I'm significantly happier, productive, and fulfilled when in a healthy relationship. I don't see myself being alone now or in the future, and instead with a person and partner who I love and respect.

2. Where do I want to live?

Right now, I really love living in Miami. I've lived all over the world, so am comfortable moving and finding a new way of life when needed or wanted. That said, I'm happy in Miami for the time being.

3. Do I want to get married again?

I don't "want" to get married again. However, that's different from saying that I "won't" get married again. I see marriage much more as an "us" thing that's needed situationally. Having been married before, I don't see marriage as a romantic gesture. Instead, I see it as a legal gesture, which is our isn't appropriate for certain relationships.

4.  Do I want to have kids?

Yes, I do. Hopefully a boy. Either way, I think I'll be an amazing Dad and believe that something would have been missed from my life did I not take that step.

5. When do I want kids?

I have some superficial milestones that I've always fallen back on for timing a family. They've mainly been economic. That said, the timing of a family, to me, is something I see being much more relevant within the context of a relationship. While the superficial environment needed for family can be ready - mainly financial stability - the relationship being ready is something I see as being most important. I'm much more focused on creating a relationship in which I'm ready and comfortable to start a family, rather than a timeframe in which I want a family.

Now, here are some of my wants for Us:

1. Do I want us to live together?

Frankly, we already do! That said, I get really insecure and sensitive about seeming like a free-loader who's taking advantage. Friends and family talk, and someone saying "Sebastian rented out his apartments so he could live rent free with Lola" isn't a conversation I want to allow to happen behind closed doors. I've felt that keeping my own apartment helps mitigate that perception, until the point that we're able to find a comfortable living situation that either I can afford to provide Us or we're comfortable mutually supporting; as by all indications, the Lola I know doesn't seem comfortable with a discussion about me paying part of her mortgage.

2. Do I want us to have a future?

Yes, I do. I love us and don't see the end. I think we're not only an amazing match, but dynamic enough of individuals to keep each other interested in the long run; which is important to me. It's feels weird trying to think about my own future without thinking about it in the context of us. I envision you being apart of my future and am happy about that.

3. Do I want us to get married?

Given our past relationships, I'm still unsure about whether marriage will be an important milestone for us. I know that for me, it's not something that I need to make me feel confident or comfortable in our relationship. That said, I want us to be cognizant of each other and communicative about what's important and needed to make each other believe and feel confident in our future. If marriage becomes a part of that, then so be it.

4. Do I want us to have a family?

Yes. I love us and see a future for us. I see part of that future being starting and raising a family.

5. When do I want us to start a family?

I believe that we're still in a process of learning to understand one another. I believe that over time we will work together to create the trust and communication needed for us to feel confident and comfortable starting a family. Both of us have traumas from our own family upbringings that I believe we desperately don't want to repeat. Because of that, I believe that being patient and open will best serve us. Where we're at today, September 2021 after 14-months dating, don't feel that we're ready to start a family together; and that okay.

Chapter 5: Vulnerability

Rejection sucks. It hurts really bad and is practically debilitating when coming from people you love.

My wants for both me and us, now that they're out there, you can reject them. And if you do, it will break my heart, but at least it will have happened deliberately and honestly.

There are so many things I hate about myself that I'm neither surprised nor offended to learn that someone else does too. To any of my wants, whether they're for me or us, you can reject some, accept some, or leave some them undecided.

Based on all the experiences you've had with me and idiosyncracies you know about me, you're the only person in the world that can decide "Sebastian would be a terrible father and I don't want to a family with him", "even though I love Sebastian, I don't see a future with him", or "I hate Miami want to leave it, without Sebastian."

Based on the same history, you're the only person that can decide whether you don't yet know what you want yet and need more time - together, or apart - to arrive at such wants and decisions.

And again, based on that same history, you're the only person that can decide you want the same or want to collaborate with me on creating an Us who we love, respect, and believe in.

The only easy relationships are the ones you don't care about. There's no perfect match in which good communication isn't needed because everyone is "understood", allowing no problems to exist.

I believe in us, and our ability as two strong people to create something fulfilling and beautiful. And because of that, I'm willing to ask you a very intimidating question following what I've laid out above...

What do you want?

Chapter 6: Wrap-up

I hope you enjoyed listening to this podcast, and by doing so you understand me better, and how I feel about us better.

My goal in producing it was to help you gain clarity on some uncertainties and insecurities that - it's seemed to me - you been struggling with when it comes to us.

I love you very much, and want to always make sure that whatever the future has in-store for us ends up happening because we were open and honest with one another about what we wanted for ourselves and each other; not because we failed to ask.

Written, and read, with love.

Sebastian
