# Letter from fights in 2021 Sitting

Dear Lola

This letter is about how I've been fucking-up at making you know I love you.

I have a lot of principles...and opinions. None of them are right. However, they're mine. So, I try to make use of them.

Many of them guide my thoughts and decisions concerning relationships. I developed and internalized them in past relationships. None of which - I frequently fail to remember - were with you.

While the way I've shaped my thinking may protect me from toxic people, I've failed to consider whether it prevents me from maintaining and enjoying healthy relationships with extraordinary ones. Are the guards I've established to keep out bad people actually just keeping out all people?

I say that with full humility; caring much more about developing a world view and philosophy for my life where I'm happily wrong rather than miserably right. I'm still a student that has much to figure out.

There have been many times during our relationship where I thought I knew how to handle a situation between us...and was wrong. Wrong because, regardless of what I did or believed at the time, my behavior hurt you. I've consistently struggled with letting my worst fears shadow your best intentions in our episodes. I know that, in all those episodes, you were acting with nothing but your best intentions. I'm sorry.

It's not fair to you that I've let ghosts of old relationships come to haunt ours. You've done nothing to deserve the skepticism, distance, and jadedness that I've maintained between us. You also have lived through your own hardships of love and friendship, yet maintain the courage to give me un-inhibited love, optimism, and support. For that, you're a bigger person than I am.

When you tell me that I take things too seriously, you're right. I characterize it by a Great Gatsby quote, "some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away." I'm tuned to being overly sensitive to the slightest tremors between us; many of which I've falsely detected. Hopefully this letter is more than a mere reflection of that, again; regardless, it's from my heart.

All these words are foreplay to some things I'd like to tell you:

- I have no excuses for how I've behaved with you.
- I'm embarrassed of my in-ability to let go of trauma and grudges.
- I believe that you deserve to be treated significantly better than what I've offered you in our relationship.
- The are many ways in which you've helped me realize how I need to mature.
- I aim to be a positive and supportive person in your life; not an emotional burden.

The ways in which I act and think are, sadly, 100% a reflection of who I am today. I have no scapegoats. However, that's not who I wan't to be tomorrow, or a year from now. In so many ways, I want to become better and believe I can.

You're an extraordinary person. I love you dearly. I can't express how thankful I am for the patience you spare as I work on myself.

Written with love
Sebastian
