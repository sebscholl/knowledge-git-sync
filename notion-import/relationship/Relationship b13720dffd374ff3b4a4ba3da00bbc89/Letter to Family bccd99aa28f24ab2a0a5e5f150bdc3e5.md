# Letter to Family

Dear Family,

I have some sad news that I feel is appropriate to share forthrightly. Several days before the new year, Valeria and I decided to separate. 

Her and I both care deeply about and love one another. Unfortunately, we've repeatedly failed to also establish a mutually supportive, fulfilling, and overall happy marriage alongside our passion. Leading us both to question our marriage too often in a way that spiralled and became hurtful.

Valeria is a wonderful and good person; no animosity is motivating this decision. I know that many of you have meaningful friendships with Valeria. As you wish to, please feel encouraged by me to keep and nuture those friendships.

I want to thank each of you for your support, wisdom, and encouragement over the past several years. It was so meaningful, and I'm deeply sorry to those who feel upset and disappointed by this outcome. I can only promise that the decision was not made spontaneously, as well as with the future in mind. 

Sincerely

Sebastian
