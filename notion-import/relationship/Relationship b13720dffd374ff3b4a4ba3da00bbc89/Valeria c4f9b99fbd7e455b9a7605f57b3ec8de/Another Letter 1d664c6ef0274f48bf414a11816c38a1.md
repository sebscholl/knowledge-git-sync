# Another Letter

Val, 

I love you and care about you deeply. That said, I think we have fundamentally different beliefs when it comes to what constitutes a healthy and happy relationship. This is something that we've struggled with for a long time, and failed to mend.

I'm confident now in saying that I no longer feel it's genuine for us to be monogamous to one another. While I harbor deep emotion for your, and believe in you building a beautiful life, it's too difficult for me to imagine a future for us based on our differences. And for that reason, I feel it's disengeuous to both of us to stay romantically committed to one another.

You and I both desire families and a future that we've continually failed to establish with each other. I want you to be happy, proud, and excited about your future. Sadly, I feel like - and have seen first hand - I'm only able to consistently make you feel sad, unloved, and unthought of, desire my efforts intended for the opposite.

I'm very proud of you for finding your apartment, an exciting new job, and giving us another chance. I will continue to be proud and believe in you. From the feelings you've expressed to me, I no longer believe that I'll be able to make you feel proud, secure, and positive about the future.

With love and regret

Sebastian
