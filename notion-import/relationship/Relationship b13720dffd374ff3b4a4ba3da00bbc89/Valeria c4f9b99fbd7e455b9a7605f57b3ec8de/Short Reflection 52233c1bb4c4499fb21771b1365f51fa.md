# Short Reflection

August - 2019

It's been wrong of me to treat this as I have.

I miss the love I once held for you dearly. All of my layers have only been an attempt at disguising that the same love has passed.

Nothing you've been doing is wrong. It's just been for the wrong person. For the right person, you as you are will forever be enough.

I care deeply for you, though the events of our relationship have eroded away my deeper feelings that once grounded my belief in us.

I'm too inexperienced to answer whether this means there really was legitimate love in the first place.
