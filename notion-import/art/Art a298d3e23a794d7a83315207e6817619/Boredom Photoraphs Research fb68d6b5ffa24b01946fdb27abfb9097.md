# What Camera and Lights Does Platon Use?

*by BUFFALO BOB on APRIL 25, 2013*

**Photographer:** Platon (full name: Platon Antoniou)

**Specialty:** Editorial and Commercial Portraiture

**Favored Camera/Lens Brand:** Hasselblad

**Other Products Used:** Profoto lights, umbrellas, Kodak & Fuji color negative film

If you’re reading this, then you definitely know who Platon is. But I’ll say it anyway: he is one of today’s greatest living portrait photographers, renowned for his incredible intimate (and sometimes quirky portraits of world leaders like Vladimir Putin, President Bill Clinton and Muammar Gaddafi, as well as entertainers like Willy Nelson.

Here is a great video of Platon discussing his work:

And here is the trailer for his segment on the Netflix show Abstract: the Art of Design, which is a must-see because we get to see Platon work on a real shoot. His subject: former Secretary of State Colin Powell.

Now, if you’re interested in producing work like Platon, my first suggestion would be to pick up any of his excellent books, particularly **[Service](https://amzn.to/2JLT054)**, his seminal book of portraits of soldiers. Note: it’s only about $30 and it’s probably a better investment than the gear I’ll discuss below.

If you’re interested in the Platon ‘look’, there’s nothing particularly interesting in his gear bag.

Platon’s primary camera is a Hasselblad 553 ELX loaded with **[Kodak Porta 160](https://amzn.to/2w9qWXm)**, which is the best color negative film ever made.

Platon also wields a Leica with **[Kodak Tri-x 400 film](https://amzn.to/2HQaBrY)**.

For lenses, he primarily uses a 120mm lens, though he used a 30mm fisheye for the famous Bill Clinton shot. A 120mm lens in the 6×6 medium format of the Hasselblad works out to about 67mm in 35mm terms.

If you shoot digitally, you could try a classic 85mm portraits lens. Every camera brand has great options at this focal length:

**[Canon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NPOB/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00005NPOB&linkCode=as2&tag=wuwc-20)**

**[Nikon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TAP096/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006TAP096&linkCode=as2&tag=wuwc-20)**

**[Sony](https://amzn.to/2jm7oGa)**

**[Fuji](https://amzn.to/2Kwrzxi)***

**[Olympus/Panasonic/Micro 4/3](https://amzn.to/2I3N62f)***

**These are roughly 85mm equivalent lenses*

For lighting subjects, he uses a single Profoto strobe head through **[a large Profoto umbrella](https://amzn.to/2HJqSTD)**.

Profoto umbrellas are very expensive. A high-quality, less expensive alternative is **[this 51″ Fotodiox umbrella](https://amzn.to/2KygsnB)**. It’s less than half the price and does the same exact thing.

Platon tends to shoot on plain backgrounds, sometimes with a strobe hitting them to add depth (though this effect may be added in post). A great way to start with these backgrounds is to get [a 53″ wide roll of white seamless paper.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ER2YQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wuwc-20) You can use a solid-color plain wall, but be aware that some paints may be overly reflective and spill light onto your subjects

Also note: It’s a lot easier to deal with these short rolls than the big ones. And remember, you don’t need a background stand setup — you can tape it to the wall with [gaffer’s tape](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QDRRIE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wuwc-20). **DO NOT USE DUCT TAPE SINCE IT WILL RUIN YOUR PAINT!!!!**
