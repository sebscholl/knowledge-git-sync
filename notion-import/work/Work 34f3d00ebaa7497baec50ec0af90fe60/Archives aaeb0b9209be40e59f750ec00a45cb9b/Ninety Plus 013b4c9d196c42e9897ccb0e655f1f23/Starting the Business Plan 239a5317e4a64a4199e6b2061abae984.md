**Ninety Plus Summary**

1) Executive Summary

- Mission Statement

"To produce coffee that inspires, and brands that epitomize"

- The Vision

"From cherry to cup, Ninety Plus coffee's are revelutionizing our industry at every level of contact. As the prominant driving force, our goal is to continue being the leader of change while acquiring simultaneously what are soon to become the most highly valed assets of the industry. Within the decade, we will own and operate 10,000 hectares of the worlds most coveted coffee farm lands."

- Brief History

"Ninety Plus Coffee was founded in 2007 as an Ethiopean green coffee import company and has grown to become the boutique specialty coffee industry's most respected brand. Expanding operations in 2009, the company aquired its first 179 hectare farm in the Volcán region of Panama. Over 30 baristas have become recognized as world champions by competing with Ninety Plus Ethiopean and Panamanian coffees, and without break are "industry experts" knocking on our door in awe and wonder of the achievments and change that the company has achieved."

- Current holdings and operations figures

- Aspired for holdings and operation figures

"The success of Ninety Plus is attributable to it's vertical integration. At every step of the supply chain, we make sure our product remains perfect. The most important step remains to be growing the actual product.

Our goal is to quickly become a patient buyer of land, and by 2024 own and operate 10,000 farm hectares in the worlds most coveted coffee growing regions. Due to the boutique specialty coffee industry being so young, such property remains easily found at prices that don't reflect its true value. This has allowed, and will allow, Ninety Plus to strategically and cheaply aquire land that will soon be seen to coffee as Napa Valley and Burgundy are seen to wine.
