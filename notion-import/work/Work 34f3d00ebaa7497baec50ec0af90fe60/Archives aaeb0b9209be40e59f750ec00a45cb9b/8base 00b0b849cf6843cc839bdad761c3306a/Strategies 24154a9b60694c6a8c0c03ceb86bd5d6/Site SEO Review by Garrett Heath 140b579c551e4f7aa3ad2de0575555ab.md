# **SEO ANALYSIS**

8base is doing a pretty good job with making sure you have the basics down for SEO. I personally abhor SEO keyword stuffing and sketchy backlinks—in fact, Google has become too smart and these don’t really work anymore. I just want to highlight some things that are table stakes when it comes to SEO. Adopting some of these practices can instantly help you, and most of them are easy to implement. Let’s dive in.

**Assign a Focus Keyword to Every Blog Post**

This is the number one thing to consider when you’re writing your blog: what is the term that would bring someone to this page? Once you have a few ideas, go ahead and Google them and see what you find. Since you’re in such a competitive space, look for results with a variety of different websites—that’s a good indication that your keyword is a viable one.

Once you have a keyword/phrase for the blog entry, you should make sure that it appears in the:

1. Blog title—closer to the beginning if possible
2. Meta description
3. First paragraph
4. Header
5. Body of the post (sprinkled throughout, without feeling contrived)
6. Image alt tags and file names

I didn’t feel that 8base was very focused with dialing into a focus keyword for the blog articles and this could be something to improve. This could help some posts get ranked on Google.

**Other SEO things to know**

- Titles should be 60 characters or less
- Descriptions should be 160 characters or less
- Try to get your keyword/phrase in the URL
- Internal links in your blog can help Google index your site and help readers find related content—this is where the “Hub and Spoke” model comes in that we’ll discuss shortly

# **CONTENT STRATEGY**

Content strategy requires a multipronged approach. Not only do you need to create the right content, you should also look at how to create a “content web” or “hub and spoke” of connected narratives and determine the best ways to gather prospect information. When it comes to disseminating the content, we’ll take a look at both organic and paid strategies in the following section. But first, let me talk a little bit about the content that you already have.

**Current 8base Blog Content**

You have blog with stories that cover tutorials, product announcements and broad industry topics, though they appear a little infrequently. Regarding the tutorials (such as building the Hackernews clone), I think you should also reference them as “hands on tutorials” in your documentation section for people to walk through.

I saw that you the following tags listed (All, For Developers, For Businesses, Announcements), I would consider adding:

- Tutorials
- Case Studies

**The one type of post that you are missing and need are customer case studies—this social proof is very important as folks are looking to use 8base.** I would also consider “Case Studies” as it’s own spot in the overall web navigation eyebrow after you get a number of them. Additionally, on the company homepage I would encourage you to put the logos of some companies for social proof. I know that this is a “trendy” thing for startups:

**What Content to Create Next**

After reviewing the keywords data for Google searches, here are my initial suggestions for topics/keywords to go after. The main topics that I see ripe for the picking are Firebase AWS, GraphQL, Serverless and Salesforce Data. You can do so by creating different blogs around these particular keywords listed below. I italicized what I would consider the bedrock piece of content—I’ll cover what that means in the next section.

- **FIREBASE AWS TOPICS/KEYWORDS*Firebase AWS (100–1,000 searches)*
Firebase on AWS (10–100 searches)
Amazon Firebase (10-100 searches)
Firebase Amazon Alternative (10-100 searches)**8base is the answer for devs looking for a Firebase-esque tool on AWS. And right now, I think that you can own these terms. I think that the piece that Sebastian wrote on Medium comparing 8base to Firebase is a good jumping off point to getting this content on your blog—make sure to follow all the SEO tips listed above. One possible title for the bedrock content for this topic is **8base: The Firebase AWS Alternative.This is the most important thing that you can do right now to get the biggest bang for your buck as you are the answer for folks looking for Firebase on AWS.**
- **GRAPHQL TOPICS/KEYWORDS*What is GraphQL (1,000–10,000 searches)*
GraphQL Query (1,000­­­­–10,000 searches)
GraphQL Tutorial (1,000­­­–10,000 searches)
Facebook GraphQL (100­–1,000 searches)
Why GraphQL (100–1,000 searches)
What is GraphQL used for (100–1,000 searches)
GraphQL vs REST (10–100 searches)
GraphQL advantages (10–100 searches)**Your company’s backbone is built on GraphQL and you are a member of the foundation. You need to stake your claim to this particular open source software and present yourself as an informed participant ready to share the GraphQL gospel. While you may never be able to overtake the foundation for some of these search terms, there are some great opportunities to get in the mix of organic search that are relatively low effort. Having a page that’s like a cheat sheet for common queries and examples could help you get bookmarked.
I know that you have a “[What is GraphQL](https://www.8base.com/what-is-graphql)” landing page, but it is currently not optimized to get picked up by search engines. Yes, it is sexy looking and addresses a lot of consumer concerns, but if you want to get ranked for the term you should consider writing a long-form piece, adhering to the SEO guidelines mentioned above.
Additionally, you could write a think piece about why Facebook uses/developed GraphQL—I know that this seems tangential to your business, but people are searching this term as their investigating whether to adopt this technology. It makes sense for 8base to be in the search mix and I think you could rank pretty easy with it.
Finally, I know that Sebastian had a tongue and cheek post on Medium with the GraphQL and REST meeting at a cocktail conference on CSS-Tricks, I think you could adapt that as a blog post to land on site that’s optimized for those terms.
- **SERVERLESS TOPICS*What is Serverless (100–1,000 searches)*Serverless Architecture (1,000–10,000 searches)
Serverless Computing (1,000­–10,000 searches)
Serverless Framework (1,000–10,000 searches)
What does serverless mean (100–1,000 searches)
What is a serverless application (100–1,000 searches)
What is FaaS (100–1,000 searches)—*note this may not apply to 8base***This is getting abstracted a little more from your business, but it may make sense to create some articles about how serverless architecture is the way of the future. You know the ins and outs of serverless infrastructure, but your front in developers and/or entrepreneurs may be searching for other information. Start at this 101-level content to help reel them in, all while selling some of 8base’s services.
While it may seem counterintuitive to make a lower search term as your bedrock piece of content, you have to consider that AWS product pages, documentation and preferred vendors are going to absolutely dominate the higher 1,000 to 10,000 search terms. However, setting your sights on a lower term could allow you to sneak in there and own that for devs who type in that particular query into Google.
- **SALESFORCE DATA TOPICS
Salesforce Data Export (100–1,000 searches)
Salesforce Data Integration (100-1,000 searches)
Salesforce SQL (100-1,000 searches)
Salesforce GraphQL (10–100 searches)
Salesforce MySQL (10–100 searches)**With your 8base Bolt product, you have an awesome ability to connect Salesforce data with application data behind a single pane of glass. That is super exciting, but it may be tricky to turn up search terms that people are looking for around this.
    
    Furthermore, I know that Salesforce was the first Bolt integration and you’re looking to connect with more applications. This is an interesting topic and something that may need more time/understanding to flesh out. Regardless, you are going to have a hard time with people currently landing on your Bolt landing page until that is determined.
    

**Value of Bedrock Content**

“Bedrock” or “pillar” content—those pieces that I had italicized—is that big tent pole of information that is most important to your customer. The idea is that you build a piece like **8base: The Firebase AWS Alternative** that serves as the “hub” and then have relevant “spokes” that come off of it.

[Hubspot provides an excellent example](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-strategy) of how this kind of bedrock content would look visually for an online fitness company:

![Site%20SEO%20Review%20by%20Garrett%20Heath%20140b579c551e4f7aa3ad2de0575555ab/image2.png](Site%20SEO%20Review%20by%20Garrett%20Heath%20140b579c551e4f7aa3ad2de0575555ab/image2.png)

For 8base, and example would be for you to create the Firebase AWS Alternative piece, providing a ton of value for the reader. Then, you should build out with the topics mentioned above, coupled with some really long tail kind of content of niche searches, that links back to bedrock piece whenever that keyword is mentioned.

Additionally, as you write for other publications like Medium, Hacker Noon or CSS Tricks, you will not only want to get a link to your top-level 8base homepage, but sneak in a link to that bedrock content whenever it makes sense.

However, creating bedrock content and linking back to it is not enough. If you’re bringing prospects into the 8base site, you want to give them a path to work down the sales funnel.

**Getting Prospects to Take the Next Step: Providing Contact Info**

Helpful content can deliver tremendous value for visitors to your site, whether they’ve arrived via organic search or paid advertising. But more than providing a one-time good read, your goal should be twofold:

1. Get the prospect past a single read and into your web of content.
2. Get the prospect to make a purchase (B2C) or give you contact information (B2B)—you’re in a weird space because I feel 8base can be both depending on the persona’s project

If all you offer is a “free read,” you’re missing the mark on content strategy: content is not just to educate, it’s to help *convert.*

*Strategies to Get the Customer in Your Web of Content*

As mentioned above, the hub-and-spoke model is good for linking to and from bedrock content. But this is just the start. Consider also:

- Linking to related content with a single italicized or bolded line between paragraphs—[news outlets do this really well](https://www.mysanantonio.com/lifestyle/travel-outdoors/article/Boerne-hotel-The-William-tops-Hotel-Emma-other-14381314.php) to keep people clicking
- Putting a graphic on the side of the blog linking to a piece of content—I did this in [my MarketingBytes.io piece](https://marketingbytes.io/hire-digital-marketing-manager/) that led Sebastian to contact me
- Having a “sticky” sidebar with top stories on the side of the blog

*Strategies for Gathering Contact Info*

Remember, the goal is not just to educate your potential consumer, it is also to gather contact information that will help you close the deal. **This is one area that 8base must work on before spending big money on paid advertisements.** Plainly put, why spend a ton of money if there is no clear-cut path for gathering some kind of info from your prospect?

One of the best ways to do this is via “gated content”—content that is so valuable, a prospect is willing to give up personal information (email, company, phone) to acquire it. Common forms of gated content include:

- In-house white papers
- White-listed white papers/research (think Gartner assets)
- Live webinars requiring registration
- On-demand webinar access
- Event invitations

Typically, as users engage with gated content, you’ll decide with your sales staff on when and how to reach out to them. The most common is by injecting them into an email drip campaign, but you could also do 1:1 outbound calls depending on the prospect’s lead score. If you have a CMS, you can probably enter this data and determine a score; if not, you may have to do this manually.

Here are the ways that I found that prospects could work down the funnel (beyond immediately signing up) on the 8base site, along with some commentary:

- **Contact Us—**starts an Intercom chat that also gives the opportunity to sign up for the newsletter or search for relevant articles; live chat has become very hot and it’s good you offer this channel to your prospects.
- **Newsletter Sign-Up—**this is at the bottom of the home page as well as the blog; your newsletter is the most important way to build an owned audience, I would make it more prevalent, such as a CTA in the middle of the blog post, because most people don’t go to the footer. Furthermore, I signed up for your newsletter and haven’t received anything—consider a double opt-in and/or a “Greatest Hits” kind of email upon sign up.
- **Talk to Sales—**this is in your “Not a Developer” section; I think that talking to sales at this point of someone being interested in 8base is really kind of like jumping to a marriage proposal on a speed date. Consider CTAs like, “See How We Helped Someone Like You” and possibly gather some customer information before showing them a customer case study. That information can be used in an email nurture track to warm them up further before an outbound call.

I would definitely advise you identifying some high-quality, high-value gated content, such as white papers, customer case studies or on-demand webinars, that can help you warm up a prospect.

*Gating a Valuable “Public” Piece*

As mentioned, one valuable piece of content that should be written is the Firebase AWS Alternative. But it can be repurposed, repackaged or blatantly reused as ungated or gated depending on the channel. For example:

- You may choose to provide super-valuable **ungated content** to help drive SEO/organic search traffic.
- However, you could use that *same piece*, turn it into **gated content** and put it into a paid social campaign to drive leads.

*Creating Gated Content by Reworking/Combining Pieces*

This is also a powerful strategy and one used by many bloggers/podcasters: take all your most popular content and assemble it into an in-depth white paper or e-book.

For example, you could put together an e-book around **A Front-End Developer’s Guide to Rapidly Building a Web App with No Back-End Fuss** that could combine information around serverless applications, how 8base makes the backend easy/is the firebase alternative on AWS and how GraphQL is efficient for front-end devs at querying a MySQL database. You are repackaging a ton of different pieces you’ve already written, but it is one cohesive narrative that succinctly solves your persona’s problem.

**Content Strategy Lighting Round**

I’m running out of time, but there are some other topics to touch on—here is a lightning round on some of other content strategies:

*Should we write more high-level “101” content?*

That higher-level content is more likely to get indexed and actually seen in organic search. However, I would strongly advise you to develop some bedrock content that you can gate.

*How would you use video, in place of or in conjunction with written content?*

Video is a tricky beast because of the time/effort/cost associated with it. It’s one thing to shoot a video on your phone, it’s another to shoot a compelling narrative that sells 8base to your target market. Use video to showcase your most valuable content, which could include:

- **Customer testimonials:** prospects are more apt to trust other customers over you
- **Overview of gated content:** you can provide a high-level discussion of the content behind that gate, ultimately enticing people to download it
- **Breaking down a tough concept:** discussing the value of serverless architecture along with how you can help front-end devs with the back-end operations seems like a smart entry point
- **Thought leadership/product development:** a chance to discuss what matters in your space (serverless, GraphQL, microservices, etc) and where you think the industry is going

Regardless, if you make a video, you need to have an accompanying blog post that goes a little deeper. Embed the video in the blog and crosslink to the blog from the YouTube description. Other important tips regarding video (not this is for any video that is not 8base Academy):

- Audio is what makes people bounce
- Lead with sizzle, not a logo
- Caption all videos
- Use B-roll to create a visually interesting video beyond the “talking heads”

I will say that the 8base Academy is very good, especially as a compliment to your robust documentation. Sebastian did a great job producing it and it should serve as a solid onboarding experience or a valuable piece of content as people consider 8base. I would consider doing the following:

1. Have a special icon in the right rail or in blog posts promoting the 8base Academy.
2. Having a callout for the 8base Academy in the eyebrow of the documentation section so people can easily find it
3. For the first two points, rather than linking to YouTube, embed the 8base Academy playlist on your owned site and provide other information around the videos—note that you could even try to embed each video on a unique page and then have a forum below to encourage questions/interaction. I know that YouTube facilitates this, but there is an advantage of sending traffic to an “owned” site.
4. Providing links on the YouTube videos back to relevant documentation articles on 8base.

*Should I be posting on Medium?*

I subscribe to the idea that you don’t want to build a business on rented land—[this post details many of the reasons why.](https://baremetrics.com/blog/medium-back-to-blog) That being said, I think that there is a time and place to post to Medium. Some of those cheekier articles that Sebastian wrote (e.g. explaining SQL and NoSQL to Grandma) along with more Growth Hacker-esque pieces (How to Better Describe Your Startup) make a lot of sense to land on Medium, especially on The Startup publication that has wide distribution.

That being said, when possible you should do the following three things whenever publishing to Medium:

1. Reference and link to the 8base homepage early in the article
2. Reference and link to any bedrock content with the relevant focus keyword, if it makes sense
3. Create a “footer” at the end of your posts that sells 8base to your audience

Additionally, you can always cross-post all those articles on your blog so you can send paid media traffic/newsletter traffic to your owned, onsite version. **However, remember to set the canonical URL on your site to the original piece so that you don’t get dinged with duplicate content.**

# **PAID SEARCH AND PAID SOCIAL ANALYSIS**

You definitely want to be running paid search and paid social media campaigns. This is a way to help distribute your content to folks interested in making applications with 8base. But before starting there are some considerations that should be made.

**Before Getting Started: Pixel Your Site**

Prior to initiating any paid media campaigns, you should go through the process of “pixeling” your site. This means that you have a piece of code placed throughout your site that feeds back information to the social networks to optimize your campaigns. Most social networks have this code available for you to create and place on your site. This code will not only help you optimize on traffic and conversions, but also empower 8base to be able to retarget previous visitors.

I didn’t see any Facebook or LinkedIn pixels on 8base—I know some tech companies do this intentionally for personal reasons (e.g. Basecamp), however, if you don’t have any hang-ups you should probably get those in place.

**Before Getting Started: Fill Your Articles with CTAs**

This is very important as you don’t want to pay just to get people to read your blog. You want to try to give a consumer many different call-to-actions. As mentioned earlier, this could be the following:

- Sign up for the 8base newsletter
- Get a piece of relevant 8base content
- Easily click through to another related piece—this would be most likely going from the 8base “hub” content you’re promoting to different “spoke” content, or vice-a-versa
- Talk to sales for more information
- Sign up for an account

The idea here is that each blog post should be chock full of “next steps.” Vary them with text call-to-actions (“Like what you’re reading? Sign up for our newsletter for the latest on development!”) or graphical ones (such as the image that Sebastian may have clicked to email me [on my MarketingBytes.io story](https://marketingbytes.io/hire-digital-marketing-manager/)). You just want to give a lot of different options for a next step.

**Search vs. Social**

While a paid search campaign addresses the consumer’s intent (i.e., seeking information), a paid social campaign is about proactively reaching out to your ideal prospect. Both are important.

In the content section, I provided some search keywords you might want to target—some are more competitive (i.e. pricier) than others to run a paid search campaign on. Find that sweet spot of terms that folks you think would be interested in 8base would be searching on and go after them.

I do see that you’re already doing some Google keywords, and it looks like you’re currently running a “branded keyword” campaign. This is savvy to do if competitors are bidding on your company terms, however, if they aren’t you are just wasting money. You might consider pulling those ads until a competitor shows up—or if you don’t want to remember to check weekly, keep them on. Additionally, you might consider running paid search campaigns on your competitors branded keywords (e.g. Prisma.io); just know that when you start that you are kind of throwing down the gauntlet and expect them to return the favor.

With respect to paid social media ads, you have the ability to cast your net around an audience based on personal, employment, geographic, and demographic data and serve them the information you want them to see. And when you pixel your site, you can retarget different visitors.

Once again, you should work out a content strategy that allows a consumer different ways to provide you with information prior to engaging in earnest on paid social. If you’re paying for traffic, you want clear ways for that traffic to convert.

**Social Channels to Target**

I imagine that 8base is looking to target IT decision makers for the bigger IBM-esque projects, JavaScript developers to get in on their projects and pre-seed startups building their tech. You may also be interested in targeting co-working spots like General Assembly in New York or Geekdom in San Antonio and students in code boot camps like Flatiron. Given that specific need, the two channels that would be best to go after are LinkedIn and Facebook.

*LinkedIn*

There are several ad units available on LinkedIn, but the two that you should focus on to reach ITDMs are sponsored posts and sponsored InMail. With both of these options, you can target on data such as:

- Job title
- Seniority
- Company size
- Industry

Additionally, LinkedIn has rolled out [interest targeting](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/linkedin-adds-new-interest-targeting-options-for-ad-campaigns/546689/), [lookalike audiences](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/linkedin-adds-new-ad-targeting-options-including-lookalike-audiences/550946/) and the ability to target on Bing search data (probably not super relevant for your business)—all further ways to reach users. Unlike other social networks, LinkedIn can be quite expensive on a CPM basis, but could make sense on a cost-per-conversion basis.

**Sponsored post campaigns** are optimized to select the “best performing” pieces of content, so you’ll want to A/B test a number of versions by varying:

- Post copy and CTA
- Main image/graphic
- URL headline
- URL description

It’s pretty dramatic how a few words, shades of color or a CTA can influence results. By loading in a bunch of variations into your sponsored post campaign, you are putting yourself in the best position for success.

**LinkedIn-sponsored InMail campaigns** are a way to connect with users in a format that’s harder for them to ignore. You’ve most likely received a sponsored InMail. Most follow a similar format: catchy intro line, demonstration of value and the CTA for you to take the next step.

These campaigns use the same kinds of audience targeting as sponsored posts but are delivered straight to the end user’s LinkedIn inbox. As of 2018, sponsored InMail did have a minimum buy-in of $5,000, but I am not sure if that is still the case.

*Facebook*

While you may dismiss Facebook as a “nonprofessional” social network, I guarantee that your audience is there. You can target by many types of demographic data, such as interests, employers, geography and even income.

Again, I would focus on getting conversions rather than traffic, so you need to have the content strategy in place. The Facebook CPM may be lower than LinkedIn’s, so you will want to carefully compare the costs per conversion to get that gated content.

There’s some nuance to Facebook targeting, but here are my top tips:

- When targeting company presidents, make you select the “President Employment” option rather than “President Interests” option; the latter targets fans of the President of the United States.
- If you’re looking to combine interests, be sure to click that little “narrow” hyperlinked text to open another section to add qualities you want to further drill down on; otherwise it’s an “or” not an “and” operator.
- Don’t use the Facebook Audience Network—it will waste your money.
- Use the conversion marketing objective whenever possible—the algorithm will optimize for getting people to download that gated content.

**TOPICS THAT I COULDN’T COVER IN THIS REPORT**

There were a few things that I was unable to address in the allotted time, including:

- The finer points of paid social campaign setup
- Why organic social doesn’t matter as much
- Importance of/strategies for 8base email nurture tracks
- The content your newsletter should have to delight your subscribers
- Strategies for interviewing customers for case studies
- The importance to monitoring and replying to queries on Stack Overflow, [such as this one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39589636/what-would-be-the-aws-equivalent-to-firebase-realtime-database)

# 

# **NICHE MEDIA BUYS**

While your owned newsletter, paid social and paid search are definitely ways to send get your message out, they are not the *only* way. One thing that is particularly interesting is getting in with niche media players along with micro and nanoinfluencers. Here are some places to explore paying to place your content.

**Hacker Noon**

![Site%20SEO%20Review%20by%20Garrett%20Heath%20140b579c551e4f7aa3ad2de0575555ab/image3.png](Site%20SEO%20Review%20by%20Garrett%20Heath%20140b579c551e4f7aa3ad2de0575555ab/image3.png)

I’m not going to spend a ton of time here since Sebastian has already guest post for them, but you do have an opportunity for 8base to pay for pieces to appear on Hacker Noon along with sponsoring their email. Here are some prices in a nutshell:

- [$199 for a paid story](https://app.hackernoon.com/brand) to appear on their site (discounts if you buy in bulk); one thing that is interesting is that [Hacker Noon apparently indexes their “brand as author” posts](https://sponsor.hackernoon.com/#brandasauthor), something unusual in the native advertising world.
- You can sponsor a [Hacker Noon newsletter that hits 25,000 mailboxes](https://sponsor.hackernoon.com/#newsletter); they give you an ad at the top and bottom with a CTA, however, they don’t disclose pricing.

**Cooper Press**

![Site%20SEO%20Review%20by%20Garrett%20Heath%20140b579c551e4f7aa3ad2de0575555ab/image4.png](Site%20SEO%20Review%20by%20Garrett%20Heath%20140b579c551e4f7aa3ad2de0575555ab/image4.png)

Cooper Press started as a two weekly newsletters (Ruby Weekly and Javascript Weekly) in 2010 by Peter Cooper as a way to distill some of the most important industry news. The portfolio now includes a total of eleven different developer topics. Some topics that jump out to me for 8base (in addition to the two previously mentioned) are Frontend Focus, Serverless Status and Mobile Dev Weekly.

8base can have the opportunity to publish relevant stories or landing pages as a “sponsored story” in one of the emails. [Pricing varies by the amount of newsletter subscriptions and you can check the rates on their media guide here](https://cooperpress.com/mediakit2020q1.pdf).

One thing that is remarkable about Cooper Press emails is that they have an open rate between 30 and 60%!

**Alligator.io**

![Site%20SEO%20Review%20by%20Garrett%20Heath%20140b579c551e4f7aa3ad2de0575555ab/image5.png](Site%20SEO%20Review%20by%20Garrett%20Heath%20140b579c551e4f7aa3ad2de0575555ab/image5.png)

This is a front-end, JavaScript [newsletter that you can sponsor a post for $600](https://alligator.io/advertise/). They did not disclose the number of subscribers, but I’m sure they’ll disclose it if you ask. Additionally, they look **wide open** for sponsorships in their upcoming calendar (nothing was on the books for November/December), so I would strongly advise contacting them and negotiating down the rate.

**Robin Wieruch**

![Site%20SEO%20Review%20by%20Garrett%20Heath%20140b579c551e4f7aa3ad2de0575555ab/image6.png](Site%20SEO%20Review%20by%20Garrett%20Heath%20140b579c551e4f7aa3ad2de0575555ab/image6.png)

A blogger, book writer and newsletter producer, Robin Wieruch purports to have a decent following (the only number I could find was 11,700 Twitter followers and he didn’t disclose his email subscribers). According to his website section called “How to Work With Me,” Robin offers the following:

> “Is your company looking for exposure to attract software engineers and web developers? I offer to place a text about your company and your open positions in front of each of my articles for a period of time as subtle advertisement. Your company name, a couple of words about it and a link to your open positions would show up to attract potential candidates for your endavour. At this point in time, this website got enough readers to make this an interesting opportunity for you. Contact me to get the details about website impressions and how this would work out in detail.”
> 

No idea on pricing, but here is the contact information: [hello@rwieruch.com](mailto:hello@rwieruch.com)

**GraphQL Weekly**

![Site%20SEO%20Review%20by%20Garrett%20Heath%20140b579c551e4f7aa3ad2de0575555ab/image7.png](Site%20SEO%20Review%20by%20Garrett%20Heath%20140b579c551e4f7aa3ad2de0575555ab/image7.png)

It doesn’t look like you can sponsor this newsletter, but I would strongly suggest submitting a link anytime you’re discussing GraphQL.

**Possible Influencers to Approach**

Influencer marketing is a tricky beast, especially with developers—after all, they are not selling a fashion accessory but rather throwing their weight behind a technology. Here are some people that may be worth considering to approach as a form of influencer marketing. But before you do, be sure to [read this post I wrote on how to approach influencers](https://futureofmarketing.tintup.com/4-things-to-consider-before-starting-an-influencer-marketing-campaign/).

- [Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/user/99baddawg/about)—GraphQL YouTuber with 41,000 subscribers, apparently taking business inquiries by emailing [benawadapps@gmail.com](mailto:benawadapps@gmail.com); **this is probably more of a niche media buy than an influencer play.**
- [Evan Weaver](https://twitter.com/evan)—CEO at Fauna; highly complementary of you on Hackernews post and interacted with you at GraphQL conference; is followed by high powered people in tech like @jack.
- [Christian Nwamba](https://twitter.com/codebeast)—JavaScript developer that you follow [who is working on demo with 8base](https://twitter.com/codebeast/status/1133356269056606208) (and [wrote about it on CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/hey-lets-create-a-functional-calendar-app-with-the-jamstack/)), Microsoft developer advocate with 30k Twitter followers; **clearly you already have a relationship with him as I dug into this further—did you hire him out to do this work?** **If so, how did that work out for you?**
- [Hassan Djirdeh](https://twitter.com/djirdehh)—front-end developer at Shopify, wrote a book on vue.js.
- [Cassie Evans](https://twitter.com/cassiecodes)—front-end developer at Clearleft, creates interesting video games and web animations.
- [Michelle Barker](https://twitter.com/MicheBarks)—front-end developer at Atomic Smash and CSS In Real Life blogger.
- Hackernews Commentor johnnyballgame—I don’t know his real name but you may be able to isolate who it is because he signed up for 8base [when the Hackernews article hit](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20887248). It may be worth trying to figure out who it is and if he has an online following.
- [Sam Wight](https://twitter.com/samwightt)—computer science student who has commented multiple times about your virtues over Firebase.
- [Jamie Barton](https://twitter.com/notrab?lang=en)—currently a developer advocate for GraphCMS, but worth following in case he leaves the company.
- [Artem Shtatnov](http://linkedin.com/in/shtatnov/)—currently Senior Software Engineer at Netflix, possibly smart to develop relationship.

# **CONCLUSION**

I tried to take as deep a dive as possible and answer as many questions around the topics you had over the phone and in email. I’m happy to set up a 30-minute meeting with both of you to answer any further questions. And if you need more help in any of these areas, I’m happy to quote out that work. Thanks!
