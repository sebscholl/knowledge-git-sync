CATEGORY,"Which category best applies to your company?Developer ToolsHow far along are you?Our product is in production with six-figure revenues and customers that range from freelance developers to IBM and NATO.We went into general availability during July 2019. At that time, we enabled our paywall, began light marketing and started onboarding developer-users. IBM discovered 8base during our beta, and signed as a paying customer in April 2019. Since that time, a team of 10 IBM developers has been building a product for NATO using 8base.During 2019, we've sold $876,000 of application development services to six customers. These engagements largely consist of startups with seed capital and a non-technical founder. Each project gets built on 8base and delivers recurring revenue from ongoing platform usage. Profits from these projects help to fund the company’s continued investment in product development.How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.I started working on 8base full-time in February 2017, incorporated the following month and began bringing on full-time team members in June of that year. The engineering team started work on our product in August 2017.Are people using your product?Yes.How many active users or customers do you have? If you have some particularly valuable customers, who are they? If you're building hardware, how many units have you shipped?IBM, NATO, and multiple startups are customers, along with 1,700 developer users.Approximately 200 developers are weekly active users; 24 are building companies that we know of. The IBM contract is with IBM worldwide, and we will begin marketing further into that channel in Q4 2019, once NATO goes live.Do you have revenue?Yes.What was your revenue in the last full calendar month?(Please use USD. If none, enter '0')40,840.22Your revenue 2 months ago?48,309.74Your revenue 3 months ago?58,302.46Your revenue 4 months ago?33,300.00Your revenue 5 months ago?28,300.00Your revenue 6 months ago?33,700.00Anything else you would like us to know regarding your revenue or growth rate?We’ll realize $85,000 in overall cash revenue this September, of which ~$5,000 is recurring.We expect recurring revenue to begin ramping up now that the product is mature and our marketing efforts initiated. We began earning recurring revenue after enabling the paywall in July 2019. Currently, ~$80,000 in monthly one-time revenue is contracted through February 2020.If you’ve applied previously with the same idea, how much progress have you made since the last time you applied? Anything change?We’ve launched the platform, raised ~$2 million in additional capital, acquired 47 paying-customers, and earned ~$1 million in revenue since last applying in September 2017.A few things have changed in our focus.:We've shifted our focus away from citizen developers (business people) and towards professional developers.We're now focused on enabling full-scale software products as opposed to shadow-IT apps.We've put aside building frontend/UI tools and instead launched a powerful and highly differentiated backend API.If you have participated or committed to participating in an incubator, “accelerator” or “pre-accelerator” program, please tell us about it.No."
IDEA,"Why did you pick this to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you’re making?As a founder of several venture-backed companies that successfully launched SaaS products, the development process always felt too fractured, variable, and expensive.Think of all the people that need help. There's unprecedented startup activity and countless companies racing to launch digital products. Hundreds-of-thousands of backend-related support topics are posted across forums and developer positions unfulfilled online. There's a tremendous need for software developers; yet, a shortage of ones experienced at building production-ready applications.I see the 8base concept as a holistic solution. It mitigates a common developer skill-gap and reduces the need for highly-specialized, and frustratingly scarce talent.8base falls into the low-code development platforms market. Although this category isn’t new, no low-code company has provided the tooling required by production SaaS apps; with developer experience in mind. The low-code market is expected to grow from $6 billion in 2019 to nearly $27 billion by 2022. Given the nuanced nature of software across varied domains, this isn’t a winner-takes-all opportunity.What’s new about what you’re making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn’t exist yet (or they don’t know about it)?What’s new about 8base is that we’re assembling the infrastructure, core systems, and integrations/services required by go-to-market applications into a single, instantly available API.Our end goal is simple; click “Create Workspace” and have everything ready but a frontend. People that don’t know about 8base resort to:Setting up and managing their own infrastructure using an IaaS provider like AWS, GCP, and BlueMix.Using a PaaS like Heroku, DigitalOcean, and App Engine that hosts/runs server-side applications.Using a BaaS provider like Firebase and AppSync.Designing and developing core systems themselves, like authentication, authorization, and file uploads/storage/retrieval.Establishing CI/CD pipelines and QA teams.(If not using GraphQL) Managing 100’s of REST endpoints to support different client applications.Hiring specialized talent and management to ensure the desired outcome of bullets 1-6.Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?Our competition includes incumbents and startups that enable application development - from infrastructure only to fully-fledged BaaS - and most of all the popular frameworks loved by developers.When it comes to 8base, we see our biggest competitor being a developer's old habits; everyone knows, old habits die hard! Once a developer acquires skills, and continues to advance them, it’s increasingly difficult to convince them not to utilize said skills and forfeit aspects of control. This makes developers incredibly committed to the services they're most familiar with.Google Firebase and AWS AppSynch are the leading BaaS products. We fear Firebase and AppSync the most given the sheer scale of their parent companies, similar messaging, and ability to price very low. We're determined to focus on delivering the most fantastic developer experience, highly differentiated features, and approachable platform; much like how Vue has come to prominence at the same time as React.Lastly, it is feasible that a flexible frontend tool company like Webflow will become interested in backend tooling and develop a competing service.What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don’t get?What we get is the magnitude to which developer experience matters.Other companies going after our market don’t seem to holistically understand developer experience. They think that it merely encompasses a clean UI and friendly support staff. ""As long as it works"" is too often the leading design principle for developer tools.8base distills services into the most understandable, approachable, and easily configured components available; drastically expediting learning curves and the time it takes a developer to accomplish something they care about.How do or will you make money?(We realize you can’t know precisely, but give your best estimate)We earn revenue from monthly subscriptions, platform usage, and optional professional services.Our professional service opportunities give us enough revenue to cover operating expenses. However, growing platform adaption is our focus and the real opportunity where a $100-million+ monthly portfolio will get built.Developers select a monthly plan for based on access to features and caps on quotas (e.g., # of API calls per month, # of table rows, etc.) - billing being per workspace. We have customers paying across every plan offered.How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?Our user acquisition strategy is bottoms-up and tailored to participating in developer communities through engaging content, support, and dev evangelism.Developers are hyper-focused on inherent utility. If a product is usable, works as advertised, and relevant to their work, adoption is quick and incredibly organic. 8base encourages developers to work in teams, which we have found to be a norm. From that we see and intentionally nurture developer referrals and user-led evangelism.In some cases, companies come on board when an employee advocates for 8base after using it on a personal project."
EQUITY,"Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet?Yes.What kind of entity and in what state or country was the entity formed?(e.g. Delaware C Corp)Delaware C CorpPlease describe the breakdown of the equity ownership in percentages among the founders, employees and any other stockholders.

LEGAL,"Are any of the founders covered by noncompetes or intellectual property agreements that overlap with your project? If so, please explain.No.Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.Our engineering team writes all the code that's unique to 8base and is led by Evgeny Semushin, our technology leader, who works out of our Miami office.I am personally responsible for product design and direction and am deeply involved in our product efforts. Our team is made up of 11 engineers and four others in product related roles.Is there anything else we should know about your company?(Pending lawsuits, cofounders who have left, etc.)No."
OTHERS,"If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.An API-first core-banking system to re-platform traditional banks and provide the necessary infrastructure for fintech companies popping up in emerging markets.Banks still spend ~14% of their revenue on IT. Newer systems - like Mambu - exclude typical startups with their pricing and sales process. The most accessible financial services software is probably Fineract, which is open source yet written in Java, poorly documented and challenging to use.A system that facilitates the learning of financial products and dramatically increases implementation velocity would be a tremendously disruptive force - both in established markets and more so in ones now pursuing financial inclusion.Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.(The answer need not be related to your project.)Life on earth is roughly bound by 100 years, more or less. However, Sequoias and other tree species live thousands of years. I researched this and learned that there's a clonal colony of Quaking Aspen trees in Colorado that shares a common root system - It's estimated to be 80,000 years old. Each tree stem lives about 100 years. However, the root system persists and continually gives life to new trees; each with identical DNA.My thinking in the area of software platforms is highly influenced by this example in nature. I think of individual applications as the stems and the underlying platform as the root system. An application to support a marketing campaign, for instance, may only need to live for 6 months, with a new one taking its place, enabled by the platform. This is an agile capability every modern business needs.And, I’m lucky that this beautiful image comes to mind pretty often."
CURIOUS,"What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply?Rob Theis, general partner of World Innovation Lab got me very excited about YC. Ryan Merket, who is one of our investors, also strongly advocated that I apply on behalf of 8base. Additionally, Andrew Parker (Papa, YC S18) and a number of other YC grads have spoken very highly of the program.That said, what convinced me to apply was the YC network in which I see so many YC alum and professional investors heavily engaged. While I've personally played an instrumental role in advancing South Florida's tech community, as well as developed an extensive network from it, I'm humbled by that which YC shares with their accepted applicants. I believe that 8base can benefit tremendously from participating in YC.How did you hear about Y Combinator?I have known about YC since it began in 2005. I don’t remember exactly how I first heard about it."
