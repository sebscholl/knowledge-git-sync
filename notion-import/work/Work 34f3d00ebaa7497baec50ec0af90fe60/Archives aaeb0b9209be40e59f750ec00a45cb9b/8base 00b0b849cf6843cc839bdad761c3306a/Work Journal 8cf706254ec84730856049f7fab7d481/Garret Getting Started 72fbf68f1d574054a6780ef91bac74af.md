# Garret Getting Started

Hey Garrett!

We've finally got the chess pieces in order to begin knocking out some case studies. Excuse us for the wait!

### Focus: Deliver Faster

### Client: Livo

In this case study, we want to take the angle that 8base - thanks to its development platform - is able to accelerate development timelines drastically. This is extremely attractive to entrepreneurs, like Bill (Client), for whom time-to-market can make or break their companies. 

Additionally, it is important to highlight that there are many rapid development tools and "quick-launch" products and services out there that the client investigated. However, he wen't with 8base for a very important reason; having an architecturally sound foundation for scale and growth.

The clients recognition of the receiving **speed and quality** from 8base is extremely important to communicate, in his own words. While investigating alternative development options (other services, agencies) the client wasn't confident in that his founder's vision would either be delivered on-time or to a standard that could withstand the market. 8base eliminated these concerns by bringing both a platform that expedites development, and tremendous expertise in how to build architecturally sound and scalable software products.

While the client anticipates being flexible and adapting their software overtime to meet customers, what a bootstrapped budget and aggressive growth plan does **not** tolerate is a entire system-rewrite once the market gets found. This added tremendous confidence in the client choosing and working with 8base, as that risk was eliminated.

### Focus: Do More with Less

### Client: Collab2Grow

In this case study, we want to take the angle that 8base - thanks to it's development platform - enables clients to accomplish larger projects using less resources than traditionally have been needed. Such resources being time, labor, and capital. This is extremely attractive to entrepreneurs, like Bob (Client), for whom is bootstrapping his business.

It is important to highlight in the vast majority of application development, 80% of the work is on "non-unique" systems. This results in loosing months - if not years - to engineers rebuilding systems that don't differentiate the product or contribute to the core innovation; keeping in mind the number of professionals needed to build and maintain such systems, and what they cost.

The clients recognition of this paradox is important to communicate in this case study. Demonstrating that the client is full-filling their vision using a fraction of the inputs often assumed to be need, yet all the receiving all the outputs. The client also should also communicate to the reader, in his own words, a recognition of the "non-unique" systems being a distraction from their business, **not added value** (like IP). An example of that might sound like, "having an internal team of Dev-Ops people is only a sunk cost, not a value ad. Seeing that I could maintain all my application infrastructure through 8base without requiring an expensive and silo'd development team; that was my tipping point." 

While the client anticipates being flexible and adapting their software overtime to meet customers, what a bootstrapped budget and aggressive growth plan does **not** tolerate is a entire system-rewrite once the market gets found. This added tremendous confidence in the client choosing and working with 8base, as that risk was eliminated.
