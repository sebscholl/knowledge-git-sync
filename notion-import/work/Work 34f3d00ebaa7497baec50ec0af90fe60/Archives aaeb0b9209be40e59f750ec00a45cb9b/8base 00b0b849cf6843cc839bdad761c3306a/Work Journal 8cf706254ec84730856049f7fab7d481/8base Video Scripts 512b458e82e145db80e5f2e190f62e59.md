## Why 8base?

So, you have an idea for an "app." That's great! Let's breakdown some of the things that you'll need to consider in order to turn that idea into a real-world application.

The apps and platforms we usually dream up are ideas about data and interfaces. What do I mean by that? Let's imagine that your idea is to make a subscription service for educational content, a marketplace for freelancers, or even a mobile app for budgets and savings. What you're probably imagining is [PICKS UP AND INTERACTS WITH PHONE] "I want some data to be displayed in an interface that looks something like this."

What you're imagining there is what we call the front-end. Whether your app is going to be on mobile, web, a smartwatch, or all of the above, the application interface that your users will interact with is the front-end. And, frankly, you need A LOT of flexibility to build your front-end however you want to since the design, branding, and overall feel can make or break your user's experience and the value they perceive to get from your product.

Now, if I asked you about your pricing strategy, the data to be collected from users, branding, and UX/UI design, I'd imagine that you'd have some pretty strong opinions. However, what if I asked whether you wanted to use GraphQL or REST as your API technology? Postgres or MySQL as the database engine? Or, which design pattern you prefer to authorize a user’s roles and permissions on the server-side?

My guess is that you'd have less of an opinion and more of a wish, which would be "I'm not sure, I just want it to work."

Unlike the front-end, the backend can be summed up as everything behind the scenes that actually powers your application. Think of it as the car engine under the hood, or the plumbing and wiring that every home requires. These resources are necessary to make an application work, though non-unique and un-differentiating to an end product.

With that in mind, it's important to realize that these backend resources are what engineering teams spend almost 80% of their time and budgets building and maintaining. And more often than not, the technology choices engineers make are not guided by what would be most resource-efficient for the business, but instead what they themselves are most familiar with or excited about learning on the job.

All this gives a lot of context to one simple question. *Why 8base?*

Well, 8base is a backend-as-a-service, meaning that we offer all of those backend resources your application needs as an API first service, so you don't have to spend your time and money reinventing, or assembling, the wheel!

The 8base platform, which is built on top of AWS, gives you the most solid foundation for an application to be built on top of, alleviating the majority of backend development responsibilities so that you and your team’s focus can purely be on data, custom business logic, and the front-end.

As a result, several or more months can be shaved off your software development life-cycle, along with $100,000's, if not $1,000,000's, in ongoing costs that usually go to paying large teams to maintain, fix, and even re-write un-differentiated systems.

Put simply, by using 8base, you get a professional-grade backend that enables application development to happen significantly faster while using smaller teams and less money. Equally as important, that backend has been architected to grow automatically with your business, from one to millions of users, without missing a beat.

## What's 8base?

8base is a backend-as-a-service, we offer all of the backend resources your application needs as an API first service, so you don't have to spend your time and money reinventing, or assembling, the wheel! 

That probably sounds great and all, however, I'm guessing that you'd like to know what is under the hood. Right? Well, here it is.

At the highest level, 8base utilizes a 3-tier serverless architecture that runs in the Amazon Cloud - or, AWS. Those tiers are stacked as follows:

1) API Gateway, where HTTPS and WebSocket requests are received

2) AWS Lambda, where access control and the 8base GraphQL engine runs

3) and, Aurora MySQL, where data gets stored and accessed

Now, what's important to understand here is that this is not only 8base's architecture. It is also the architecture that you get automatically provisioned with new projects - or as we call them, *workspaces.* This means that 8base sets up a dedicated API, Data, and Security layer for your project in just a few seconds.

Beyond the 3-tier architecture, the 8base platform goes further by pre-configuring commonly required application services. Things like:

1) 8base Data Builder, for defining relational data-models

2) 8base Instant GraphQL API, for auto-generated API CRUD and Subscription operations

3) S3, for file and image uploads and storage

4) Auth0, for user authentication - though we let you use any OpenID provider

5) as well as, AWS Lambda, for deploying custom business logic as serverless functions

8base gives you all of this as a ready-to-use and managed service, among many other valuable resources and tools for building professional grade software applications - so you and your team can dedicate more focus to your project's core innovations. All the while, resting assured that your application's backend is running on a rock solid foundation that will grow with your business from one to millions of users, without missing a beat.

## How to use 8base?

For those of you who understand what 8base is, as well as why you'd want to use the 8base platform for your application backend, I'd like to now share with you how you can use 8base - since there are three ways.

The first, is as an individual developer building their own apps. Whether it's a hobby project or new business idea, individual developers can sign-up for their first free workspace right on our website, [8base.com](http://8base.com). That free plan will let them configure their application backend, and upgrade to a low-priced paid subscription once ready to remove API throttling and get off to the races.

For these developers, 8base's documentation found at docs.8base.com, and video tutorials on the 8base Academy YouTube channel, are fantastic resources for them to get up and running fast and build something awesome.

The second, is as an digital agency or dev shop building projects on behalf of clients. All to often do we meet agencies and dev shops that have amazing front-end talent, though experience project delays, on-going maintenance nightmares, and scalability issues that are all caused by quickly thrown together backends. All of which leads to un-happy clients and projects often running over budget - sometimes, even at a loss.

For these businesses, 8base is an amazing resource, as it handles in seconds what takes many backend developers weeks to set up - usually, for every project! If this sounds like you, lets get in touch. Our team will help design a plan that will allow you the number of workspaces you need, production level usage quotas, and a meaningful number of support hours; should you or your team need them along the way.

The third, is as a non-technical, or technical, business leader who thinks 8base looks awesome and want's our team to develop on their behalf. To date, we've helped over a dozen companies and startups build their products with our professional-services team; which we call 8base Labs. This is a white-glove service where we'll manage the full development of your application; design, development, deployment, and on-going maintenance. 

With 8base Labs, we have full flexibility to engage with you as you need. Whether that's for the full application development life-cycle - as just mentioned - or just setting up the backend on 8base. If this sounds like something you'd like to learn more about, we'd love to speak with you! We also have many references that are excited about sharing with you their own experience working with us.

Just reach out over email at hello@8base.com! Our team is excited to learn about how we can help you build something awesome.
