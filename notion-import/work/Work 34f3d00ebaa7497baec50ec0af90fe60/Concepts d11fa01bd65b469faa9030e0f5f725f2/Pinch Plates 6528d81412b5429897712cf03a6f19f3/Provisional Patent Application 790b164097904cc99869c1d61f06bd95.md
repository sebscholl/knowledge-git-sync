### Exercise Plates Designed to be Gripped by Pinching to Increase Muscle Hypertrophy

**BACKGROUND** 

**Field of the Invention:**

- A fitness accessory that gets used in conjunction with resistance bands, or cables, that drastically increases muscle hypertrophy in arm and chest exercises.
- EXAMPLE: The present invention is directed to an athlete, workout enthusiast, or body builder that desires to create a more chiseled and defined pectorals, triceps, biceps or forearms, all while minimizing and limiting shoulder (anterior shoulder) overuse. Such individuals would be able to use the invention both at a home gym or public gym, whether it is owned by the individual or provided by the public gym.

**Description of the Related Art:**

- The current art exists in two versions.
    
    ![Provisional%20Patent%20Application%20790b164097904cc99869c1d61f06bd95/New_Project_(1).jpg](Provisional%20Patent%20Application%20790b164097904cc99869c1d61f06bd95/New_Project_(1).jpg)
    
    The first version of the art is a flat plate made of plastic, metal, or a composite material with a high friction surface (textured) on both of the flat sides. Along the outer rim - which may range in thickness - multiple holes are cut through, or loops added, so that a carabiner, rubber/elastic resistance band, or rope/string may be secured to the outer rim of the plate. This allows for the trainee to pinch the plate on either side (as if between two hands clapping) while a weight, resistance band, weighted cable, or other attachment is secured and pulling on the plate (by gravity or other resistance).

    The second version of the art is a flat plate made of plastic, metal, or a composite material with a high friction surface (textured) on both of the flat sides. The outer rim is attached in such a way that it rotate freely around the inner plate. Along the freely rotating outer rim of the plate - which may range in thickness - multiple holes are cut through, or loops added, so that a carabiner, rubber/elastic resistance band, or rope/string may be secured. This allows for the trainee to pinch the plate on either side (as if between two hands clapping) while a weight, resistance band, weighted cable, or other attachment is secured and pulling on the plate at any arbitrary or changing angle (by gravity or other resistance) without demanding the trainee adjust their pinched-grip or cock their wrists to accommodate the angle of resistance.
    

**SUMMARY** 

- One embodiment of the present invention, is that it be used to increase the effectiveness of many dynamic chest and arm muscle workouts. By employing a pinch style grip the trainee must flex more muscles as to hold the plate in place. This is a significant difference from the current way of gripping weights, bands, and bars, in which the fingers wrap around a cylindrical grip to conveniently hole the workout equipment.
- Another embodiment of the present invention, is that it be used by athletes working towards fine tuned muscle development. The increased muscle hypertrophy in arms and chests exercises when using the present invention further develops the muscle to achieve a more "chiseled" aesthetic.

**BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS** 

![Provisional%20Patent%20Application%20790b164097904cc99869c1d61f06bd95/New_Project_(2).jpg](Provisional%20Patent%20Application%20790b164097904cc99869c1d61f06bd95/New_Project_(2).jpg)

The present invention has the ability to be utilized to the trainees benefit using multiple methods. Three of those methods are detailed below.

1. Cable attachment - attaching the plate to a weighted cable machine allows the trainee to experience resistance at many different weights and angles, while moving the plate towards them and away from them in a controlled motion.
2. Resistance bands - attaching the plate to resistance bands allows the trainee to experience resistance at many different angles and tensions, without the need of weights, while moving the plate towards them and away from them in a controlled motion.
3. Weight attachments - attaching the plate to a weight using a band or cord allows the trainee to experience the gravitational pull of the weight, while moving the plate towards them and away from from them in a controlled motion. 

**DETAILED DESCRIPTION** 

10: An exercise accessory that increases the intensity of chest and arm workouts by using a pinch grip as opposed to a clench grip.  

12: A flat plate with an outer rotating rim, to which cables, resistance bands, and weights can be attached, for the efficacy of intensified muscle training.

14: A flat plate that has high friction grips on either side, and to which cables, resistance bands, and weights can be attached, for the efficacy of intensified muscle training.

16: A fitness accessory, in the shape of a flat plat with textured surfaces on opposing sides, that gets used in conjunction with resistance bands, or cables, that increases muscle hypertrophy in arm and chest exercises.

18: A fitness accessory, in the shape of a flat plat with textured surfaces on opposing sides and an outer rotating rim, that gets used in conjunction with resistance bands, or cables, that increases muscle hypertrophy in arm and chest exercises.

20: A fitness accessory pinched between both palms in a clap like position that increases the muscle stress intensity of chest and arm workouts.

22: A flat plate, used for fitness and muscle training, that increases muscle hypertrophy in arm and chest exercises when pinched between both palms.

**CLAIMS** 

A flat plate, used for fitness and muscle training, in conjunction with cables, resistance bands, and weights.

**ABSTRACT** 

The present invention gets pinched between a trainees two palms, and can or cannot be attached to a resistance band, cable, or weight. An outer rim of the plate may, or may not, rotate. Hole, or loops, along the outer rim of the plate allows for resistance bands, cables, or weights to get attached. Moving the plate to and from the trainee increases muscle hypertrophy in arm and chest exercises.
