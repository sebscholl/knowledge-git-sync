# Black Palm

> Black Palm Society
> 

This document articulates a business concept that brings together technology, hospitality, and community. **Black Palm** is a membership focused 3rd Space concept which will unite, inspire, and grow Miami’s creative and entrepreneurial communities. The concept challenges traditional F&B business models by focusing primarily on monthly reoccurring revenue (MRR) realized through memberships sales. Designed to provide a unique watering hole for entrepreneurs, creatives, and professionals alike, **Black Palm** will launch in one of the world’s fastest growing and most international cities - **Miami, FL**.

## Influence

Effectively building community - online and offline, internal and external - is a strategic priority to modern companies. Many successful social-tech companies provide community building platforms and products; making the building of such systems their core focus. 

From aviation to agriculture, there's a recognizable shift in marketing. Fewer and fewer companies directly market their products and services directly anymore. Instead, they **market themselves as an idea** - ones that become materialized, sometimes, through their products and services. 

Around an idea, people find identity, as well as understanding. Idea's have the power of converting customers into crusaders of a company's mission, transcending them from simple consumers to supportive community members. Such is achieved by businesses **selling ideas** of community, collaboration, creativity, and independence. 

> These businesses provide watering holes.
> 

We are social beings. Both in life and work. Every watering hole has the potential to attract a different audience by empathizing with a core human needs. The need for space, inspiration, identity, and society. There is value in providing both a vision and understanding of that, as well as an environment which makes such a idea tangible.

Space to pursue business and leisure, whether it's personal or professional, is in high demand. **Black Palm** believes there to be a significant opportunity in appealing and providing a 3rd space to Miami’s creative and entrepreneurial spirit. The individuals that are driving Miami’s culture and growth, whether they’re doing so running an out-of-the-gate fashion startup or as seasoned real estate players. 

The former profile, as it now stands, works from a cafe. Work for them is completed most comfortably in social environments. The later profile is a networker. Seeking opportunity through social collision. Collectively they both make up a community of “do-ers” and seekers. Combined, they form bedrock on which culture, influence, and community develops. 

## Statement of Purpose

**Black Palm** is seeking a start-up capital investment of X in the form of a business loan or equity partnership. The initial investment will serve to purchase equipment, inventory, and all other necessary start-up expenses detailed in this plan. 

This sum will be sufficient to launch a profitable 3rd space concept, providing a solid financial platform from which the business can grow. 

After spending many years traveling the world as a keen observer of international cafe culture, Sebastian Scholl gained insight, expertise, and experience in the industry to which few lifelong professionals can claim their breadth of knowledge equal. A writer, artist, and software developer, Sebastian's spent more of his career working from cafe’s than traditional offices. 

As cultural shifts have enable new freedoms in remote work opportunities for millions of individuals, Sebastian believes the time is now for this opportunity. Taking advantage of the ever growing demand for a 3rd space in urban life. 

Most importantly, **Black Palm** is not intended to be a single eclectic hospitality concept. It's intended to be a respected brand, among the likes of SoHo House and NeueHouse. One that will be designed from day one to have replicable operations and the expertise necessary to open in other appropriate major metropolitan neighborhoods. 

The **Black Palm** mission is to become the first internationally recognized and understood 3rd space.

## Business Description

Black Palm will have two primary focuses; membership, F&B, and r.

**Membership**

The **Black Palm** membership is simple. $60 per month grants a members unlimited coffee + tea beverages, and 10% off all other products. Memberships can be purchased through the **Black Palm** website or mobile app and it will be asked that the new member fill out a profile. 

This profile is optionally made public in a members directory, where all members get featured. The directory will be seen as a resource for members, enabling better visibility for everyone and less friction for introductions and collaboration.

Membership will be capped at 1000 members (per location). Additionally, members will not have to wait in line at the register, and instead be able to scan their own app hosted membership QR code to order directly from the barista. A pre launch marketing campaign will aim to sell 250 memberships before opening day. An emphasis will be put on training the staff to remember members names and “usual” order.

**Cafe Retail**

Black Palm will operate as a fully operational third wave specialty cafe while selling cold pressed juices and vegan/vegetarian snacks. All snacks and juices will be purchased wholesale from local providers in Black Palm branded packaging. All products will be available to members at a discounted rate of 10%.

From 6:00pm till closing, wine and beer will be sold by the bottle in a New Orleans wine bar fashion. Alcohol will **not** be sold in the non-member's area - which closes at 6pm. This style of service allows customers to purchase wine and beer by the bottle, be handed glassware, and allowed to seat themselves. It is an informal and extremely comfortable way to serve large crowds with minimal labor. Between the hours of 6pm and 8pm, Monday through Friday, members will enjoy a 15% discount on all alcohol for *happy hour*. The intention being that members will arrive in the morning, work through the day, and follow straight through into happy hour. However the Black Palm Society will close at 10:00pm each night, as not to be viewed as a local bar or nightlife venue.

> Environment & ConceptThe Black Palms Society - as a space - can be imagined as so. A noticeably open and raw industrial space. At the front, a several hundred square foot area is open to the public - allowing anyone access to a limited stretch of the centrally situated circular cafe counter. This counter meets the left wall of the space, and stretches out to the opposing side to meet a metal turnstile. Members use unique QR codes stored on a mobile app to allow themselves access to the larger space through the turnstile. There are no visual barriers to the separation of member and nonmember space.

> The member’s area is a stadium like environment that’s centrally oriented. Each wall lined with cushioned bleachers reaching three levels high - guiding the focal point of the room to center where pods of chesterfield couches face one another separated by low rise wooden platform carts. World clocks line the walls above the bleachers, tracking a major city from each time zone to impart an international awareness. In the center of the back wall, the clock that owns EST time will be twice the others in size with the minute hand’s end sporting a black palm leaf.

> At the center most tangent of the circular cafe counter, a wrought iron pole is implanted, reaching several feet skyward. On top of it a 360-video camera is installed. All day, the space is live streamed to it’s own YouTube360 video channel. Anyone in the world can to take an observer's seat within the community. Placing a smartphone into a head mounted display (HMD virtual reality viewer) would allow anyone to feel present.At weekly programmed speaker series held in a coliseum fashion, YouTube Live viewers will have a front row seat - again, leveraging the latest open technology in 360 live video streaming. Members will line the cushioned bleachers as presenters take the floor. Speaker series, inspired by TEDTalks, will serve as a constant stream of ideation and inspiration. Broadcasting these events as public VR experiences is unique and progressive.From 6:00pm till closing, wine and beer will be sold by the bottle in a New Orleans wine bar fashion. Alcohol will not be sold in the non-member's area - which closes at 6pm. This style of service allows customers to purchase wine and beer by the bottle, be handed glassware, and allowed to seat themselves. It is an informal and extremely comfortable way to serve large crowds with minimal labor. Between the hours of 6pm and 8pm, Monday through Friday, members will enjoy a 15% discount on all alcohol for happy hour. The intention being that members will arrive in the morning, work through the day, and follow straight through into happy hour. However the Black Palm Society will close at 10:00pm each night, as not to be viewed as a local bar or nightlife venue.Looking further into speaker programming, events will be scheduled during two designated time slots on any open day of the week. 12:00pm to 1:00pm and 5:00pm to 6:00pm are those hours. This enables members to schedule their own days accordingly, as well as creates consistency for the virtual following. The speaker schedule will be publically posted on a display in the space as well as online. The topics discussed will focus on the work of individuals in the community, as well as invited guests. For example, a weekly event could be an Open Floor Startup Investor Pitch - whereas an invited guest speaker could range from a local startup founder explaining their tech stack to Panther coffee talking about coffee origin.
