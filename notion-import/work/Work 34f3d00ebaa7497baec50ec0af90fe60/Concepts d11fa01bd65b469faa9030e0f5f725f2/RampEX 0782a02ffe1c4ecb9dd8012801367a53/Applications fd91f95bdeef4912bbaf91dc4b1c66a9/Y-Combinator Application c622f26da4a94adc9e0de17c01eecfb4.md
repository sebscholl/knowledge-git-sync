*Please tell us about the time you, sebscholl, most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.

To clarify, the definition of a hack that I've adopted is, "a strategy or technique adopted in order to manage time and/or activities in a more efficient way."

In the Spring of 2013, I felt restless. My past few years in Boston had left me craving a change of scenery. To scratch that itch, I applied for study abroad programs to attend my senior year. However, a logistical problem stood in my way. I had a lot of stuff.

Working real estate had led me to find an amazing deal on a large apartment. My closets overflowed with (I later counted) hundreds of articles of clothing. Furniture and appliances crowded the rooms. Were I to travel, all of this stuff would have to be stored or let go. The deadline to confirm my attendance for the abroad program was 3-weeks away.

Sparing everyone the philosophical manifesto, I'll just say that my predicament inspired several materialistic revelations. Mostly having to do with the burden of ownership. Suddenly changed to see my possessions as hindrances, I was forced to critically evaluate what was truly material. The answer was 32.

Through a process of elimination, I identified 32-articles of clothing, alongside a small messenger bag of electronics (laptop, camera, kindle, ect..) that covered my essentials. Everything could fit in one carry-on duffel bag. Not only would minimalizing allow me to travel easily. Wherever I'd go, my "footprint" could comfortably come with me.

The purging process was nothing unique. For the most part, I became the benefactor of the month at a local Goodwill. By the second week, I had sold all my furniture and appliances through Craigslist and was sleeping on an air mattress. By the deadline, I'd negotiating a lease break for the start of summer. The money netted from selling furniture gave me a generous travel budget for the summer. I've seen much more of the world thanks to it.

My 32-articles of clothing became an extremely enabling wardrobe hack. How I curated the items allowed me to be comfortable and stylish whether I dressed up or down, athletic or leisure. Meanwhile, to accomplish the same, my friends

were tied to their respective residences while spending $1,000's each year. To this day, I've adapted my minimalism as needed. Yet the core principle has been a true advantage in how I've since led my life. Keeping me focused on essentials, and able to seize the opportunities that others allow indulgences to bar them from.

*Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.

At age 17 I was a semi-professional extreme whitewater kayaker. Such athleticism led me to have one of the last descents of the Great Bend of the Yangtze River, paddle with the world's best kayakers, and eventually walk on to Boston University's Division-1 crew team.
