# Traditional Drop Shipping vs. The Future

### The 1.0 Model

AliExpress → Oberlo → Shopify → THE CUSTOMER → Shopify → Oberlo → AliExpress

The issue here is that most of the products are in China. This leads to really long shipping times and as well as poor customer experiences on the delivery side since things are often shipped with poor labels and packaging.

Here, you normally have to order the products as well so that you can get quality photos. 

AliExpress is actually pretty unstable and has awful customer service.

### The 2.0 Model

Spocket → Shopify → THE CUSTOMER → Shopify → Spocket

Here you're finding suppliers in the countries that you are shopping to and can get 3 to 5 business days shipping.
