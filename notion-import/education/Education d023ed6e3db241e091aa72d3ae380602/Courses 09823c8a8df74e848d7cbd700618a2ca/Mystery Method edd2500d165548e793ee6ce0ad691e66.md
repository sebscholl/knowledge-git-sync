# Mystery Method

Neg Theory - hot girls are bombarded by guys being nice and trying to hard. Therefore they develop bitchy outward attitudes. You need to demonstraight higher value before anything. 

Guy: Nice nails, are they real.

Girl: No

Guy: Ohhh, well I guess they're still nice.

After negging, once she gets defensive, start to compliment her - but not her beauty. 

"I was only trying to find your boundaries, now that I know them, I'll respect them."

Guy: "I don't think we should get to know each other."

Girl: "Why"

Guy: "You just seem like to much of a nice girl for me"

Girl: Something...

Guy: "Hah, you don't get out much; do you?"

Girl: Interupts

Guy: "Hellooo, I'm speaking."

Girl: Goes to kiss both cheecks...

Guy: "Just one, don't be greedy."

Girl: "I'm a model"

Guy: "Like a hand model?"

Girl: "You are so young"

Guy: "Yeah, I've noticed. Poor you. Take a moment to get over this name thing. I'll wait."

Guy: "You can dress her up, but you can't take her anywhere."

Sniper Neg: Something only she would hear

Guy: "Wipe your nose", "You have crusty eyes", "You spit on me."

Guy: "Introduce me to your friend. That's the polite thing to do."

Use this in every set:

Guy: "How do you all know each other?"

Never agree with the girl over the guy. Care more about your wings feelings than the girls feelings.

When delivering a neg, turn away before it lands. Do not look for the reaction. Demonstraight that you do not care about the reaction.

Women are attracted to the highest value man in their social context. Win over her group and you'll win over her friends. By winning over the group and negging the target, you demonstrate a lack of interest in the target (girl all the other guys had attacked). This begins the turn the group into your favor. This is the epitome y of A2.

"Remove the girls sexual influence over you and then make her chase you to get it back".

Don't focus on situational relevance. It runs dry quickly and ends the conversation. In the beginning, expect you to contribute 90% of the conversation - practice talking to everyone. 

Think of talk tracks as threads. Don't fear cutting of a thread, her or you. 

The goal is to convince the girl and her friends that you are not interested in her, to confuse her of why.  

IOI's - subtle and distinct indicators of interest, showing that a girl or guy is developing interest in you.

- Ask you your name
- Giggles (!)
- Re-engages conversation (!)
- Tosses hair
- Keeps looking at you
- Holds eye contact
- Turns body to you
- Asks you for something (light or time)
- Compliments you
- Nicknames for you
- Touches you in any way (!)
- Comes back after the bathroom
- Needs someone to show here how to do something
- Introduces you to friends
- Buys you a drink
- She tells you she is leaving (ask her number)
- She asks where you are going (invite her to come)
- She looks for or takes opportunities to be alone with you

Passive IOI's are the most common, meaning that she doesn't do something:

- Her friends leave but she stays
- You leave and she follows you
- She doesn't move if you get too close

Fake IOI's include:

- Flirting when she asks for a drink
- Touches you when saying "going to the bathroom"
- Seeing if you reciprocate too easily

IOD's (Indicators of disinterest)

- Leans away
- Looks away
- "Uhuh"
- Acts like she didn't hear you

Tell fun stories that don't outwardly compliment or elevate yourself. Demonstrate the leader of men and attraction switch in stories. 

"I was standing there, minding my own business when suddenly I felt this large hand caress my left ass cheek. I spun around on a dime to see a large man with a handle bar mustache smiling at my. I felt so embarrassed!"

Prop anchoring is when you place something on the target.

When a guy walks up to the set to try to steal them.

Guy: "Oh did you come to buy these girls drinks? I'll take one too if you're feeling up to it!"

The spin is the when you take a girls position at the bar. Ask her to put her arms out, and take her for a spin, and then tease her about taking her spot.
