# Use Engaging Visuals and Captions

### Visuals

Most effective media is Single Image and Single Videos. 

This is where you upload 3 pieces of media.

Make sure you have variation and make sure to look at existing ads that are being served successfully.

If photos blend in too much (to natural) people might miss it while scrolling. Make sure that you have a mix of product focused show with a nice native feel.

In the beginning, test BIG DIFFERENCES. Not small tweaks.

Facebook prefers less text in images. Use the Facebook text checker tool to pre-screen image assets.

### Captions

AIDA = Attention, Interest, Desire, Action

Prioritize image/media over the ad itself. Focus on benefits, not features.
