# Set the right budget and schedule

On conversions, you need to spend the right amount to be able to win auctions. 

Budget types:

1. Testing Budget ($10 > per day): Run test ads for **at least 3 days.**
2. Scaling Budget: (You now need 50 conversions per week to optimize, which is a good reason to shoot for Ad to Cart conversions since it will then be cheaper to optimize)
    1. Duplicate Ad Set
    2. +20% per day inch the budget up.

**Always leave successful Ad Sets alone. Do not touch them. Duplicate, find success with tweaked parameters, and then cancel out the less performing ones of the batch.**

**If you have a successful ad, duplicate it and it fails, don't hesitate to duplicate it again.**

Don't bother with start and end dates. If something is successful, the changed parameters will kill it.

Teacher creates ad sets across different geographies for contextualization.

When setting conversion windows, this is the span during which a conversion changes. Set these to match the purchase behavior (quick sale vs. nurtured sale)
