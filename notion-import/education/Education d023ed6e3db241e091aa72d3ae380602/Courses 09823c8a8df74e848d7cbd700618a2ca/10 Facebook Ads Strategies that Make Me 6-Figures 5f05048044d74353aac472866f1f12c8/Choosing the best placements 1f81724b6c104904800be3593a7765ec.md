# Choosing the best placements

In Ad Set set, never use Automatic Placements. Instead, use Edit Placements.

For gender neutral products, leave the Gender targeting off. 

It's good to split on Platforms though (different Ad Sets for different platforms),  since different platforms will have different cultures.

Don't use Audience Networks.

Don't use Messenger.

Stick to Instagram and Facebook in separate Ad Sets, and only use the Feed options (in Feeds).

You can target specific mobile devices, but there is no need. It's better to allocate more budget to a fewer ad sets.

If using Audience Network, Instant Articles, and In-stream videos, you can exclude certain publishers or networks.
