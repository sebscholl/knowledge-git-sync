# Leveraging Custom Audiences and Lookalike Audiences

By specifying a Custom Audience, you can start to target groups of people without the targeting. When the Facebook Pixel is installed on your site, this means that you can target people that have visited your site by using Website Traffic audience.

With website traffic, you can target people who took actions in your site but didn't convert at every level of the funnel.

Lookalike audiences are where you take a custom audience and then amplify it.

When building Lookalike audiences, do it by country. You can then expand out from the 1% of relevance, 2%, 3%, ect... The whole time excluding already purchased.
