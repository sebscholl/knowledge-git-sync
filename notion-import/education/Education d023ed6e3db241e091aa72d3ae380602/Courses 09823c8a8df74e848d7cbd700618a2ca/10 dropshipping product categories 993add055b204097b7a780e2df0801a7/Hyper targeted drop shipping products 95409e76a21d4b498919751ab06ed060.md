# Hyper targeted drop shipping products

These are products with an unusually high relevancy to a specific audience. It's usually a work backwards strategy, where you identify a targetable group and then find the right products to push.

Examples:

1. Selling iPhone cases to people with iPhones
2. Military branded gear to people in the Military
3. Zodiak bracelets to people whose birthdays are in a specific month

The goal here is to see how specific you can get on a specific audience. Once you have that, then find a product to place to them.
