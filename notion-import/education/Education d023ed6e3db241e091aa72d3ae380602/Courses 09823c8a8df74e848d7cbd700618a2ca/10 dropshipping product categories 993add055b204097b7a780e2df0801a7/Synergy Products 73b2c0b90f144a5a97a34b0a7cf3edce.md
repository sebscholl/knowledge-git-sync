# Synergy Products

Cross-selling is where we sell different products while up selling is where we sell them more expensive products. These both relate to synergy products.

Examples:

1. Phone cases, Selfie sticks, Phone chargers
2. Protein Shake Bottle, Home pull-up bar, resistance band
3. Luggage cover, travel pillow, cosmetic containers

All these examples could be sold in the same store and it is likely that a person would purchase all three of them.

These products are related by niche, product type, and target audience. They again aim to maximize average order value. 

These also make the most out of your social media followers and lists. Meaning that if one buyer is attracted, you are most likely to keep relevant information coming.
