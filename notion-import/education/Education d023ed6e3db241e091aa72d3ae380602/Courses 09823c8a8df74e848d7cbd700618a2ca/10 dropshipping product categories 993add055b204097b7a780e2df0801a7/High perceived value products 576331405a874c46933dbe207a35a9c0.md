# High perceived value products

These are products that are **perceived**  to be valuable though cheap to make. For examples, watches. 

1. Watches
2. Wireless phone tech (headphones)
3. Wireless chargers
4. Novelty products (quality, think the Ace of Spades bottle opener)

The goal in these is the profit margin. How cheap are they vs. how much can you make.

The great thing about these is that they look great so that they can be advertised as quality.

Don't worry as much about the total sale price as you do the margin on the item. The trick to these products is that the make great first impressions on your sites.
