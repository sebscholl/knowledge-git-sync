# Repeat products

Products that get consumed, depleted, or expire.

Examples:

1. Make up
2. Gym gloves (things that wear down over time and need replacement)
3. Baby clothes (your kid grows and you keep needed more clothes)

Limited capacity for use and helps maximize customer lifetime value. These products are essential since repeat customers are essential for long-term business.

It's not always about finding new customers, but for longevity sake making sure you have the highest repeat order rate as possible.
