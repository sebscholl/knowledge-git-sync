# Find your Tribe - Choosing Winning Audiences

Having 5 messages, each with 3 visuals, gives you 15 message-visual combinations for the algorithm to test. Always think of the number of variations as the goal. The more possible variations, the more chances of success. 

With 15 different message-visual combinations, you can layer 3 audiences per media, giving you a total of 45 message-visual-audience combinations. 

*"Each person in the audience can get a different combination. So for a 15 message-audience combination and one audience of 500,000 people, the Algorithm can produce 7.5-million combinations in total."*

### Find your Tribe

1. Audience Quantity
    1. One multi-layered audience: If you know an audience well, you can simple focus on one audience with multi-layered targeting. This drills down the targeting to be more detailed.
    2. Three multi-layered audiences: If you are fuzzy on your audience, create three versions of the former.
    3. Ten single layer audiences and then combine winners into a "pooled" audience for scaling: If you have no idea who the audience is, create 10 separate audiences with a single interest/layer to see which ones perform best after a test period and then combine the top performing layers into a multi-layer audience.
2. Audience Size 
    
    Every audience size has the potential to bring in profit. However, 1m - 10m more often allows room for success and then scaling. When you're targeting a group 100,000 person audience, you're not actually showing your ads to 100,000 people. When you ads first launch, the first people who see your ads will be who Facebook uses to optimize your target audience. It carves out a 10%-20% range of that audience, so you're actually targeting 10k to 20k audience. 
    
    1. Less than 500,000 possible range
    2. 500,000+ minimum range
    3. 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 ideal range
    4. 10,000,000+ possible range
3. Audience Targeting
    1. System Based
        
        These are the choices Facebook actually provides and you can select.
        
        1. Demographics (male, female, etc...)
        2. Keywords (travel, fiteness, etc...)
        3. Interests (politics, books, etc...)
        4. Behaviors (page admins (business owners), etc...)
        5. Competitors
        6. Platforms / Tools (websites (shopify), apps (robinhood), services, etc...)
        7. Lifestyle (traveling, cycling, etc...)
    2. Audience Based
        
        Consider all of these things when developing your ad sets in terms of the audience that you are approaching.
        
        1. Problems
        2. Pains
        3. Fears 
        4. Desires
        5. Biases
        6. Tendencies
        7. Beliefs 
        8. Values
        9. Misconceptions
        10. Objections
        11. Stimuli
        12. Responses
        13. Uniques - If you're selling to boxers, don't use Mohamad Ali as an interest, because he is so popular you get a ton of spillage into other people that like the personality though not the subject. You could use that though in multi-layer, so that you make sure you weed out the wrong individuals.
        

Tips:

- DON'T artificially ad layers or decrease layers to change the audience size
