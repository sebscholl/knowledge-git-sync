# Observe the laws of the universe - Complying with Facebook Policies

Different Levels of FB compliance:

1. Business Manager
    1. Using business manager lowers the risk of your account being banned. [business.facebook.com](http://business.facebook.com) 
    2. Within Business Manager you can have multiple ad accounts. You want multiple accounts in case one of your ad accounts gets banned. In the beginning, they give you between 1 and 3 accounts when you're starting.
        1. Create blank templates and DON'T add CC or personal info to the unused ones. FB will banned all accounts with matching credentials.
    3. Make sure to maintain a 10:1 approval to disapproval ratio. If you continually get denied from FB Ads you will get banned.
        1. When you get an ad that's approved, make a bunch of duplicate ad sets so that your ratio goes up and then turn them off as soon as they go live.
2. Page or Profile
    1. Make sure that all your pages are complete. All media assets, bio, about, contact, etc...
3. Ads
    1. Don't make unrealistic claims about the products. Don't infringe copyrights. Ready all policies. Don't annoy people or confront angry people.
4. Website
    1. Have a custom website with a proper domain and multiple pages. Proper terms of service with contact page. Have multi-media assets and navigation links.
