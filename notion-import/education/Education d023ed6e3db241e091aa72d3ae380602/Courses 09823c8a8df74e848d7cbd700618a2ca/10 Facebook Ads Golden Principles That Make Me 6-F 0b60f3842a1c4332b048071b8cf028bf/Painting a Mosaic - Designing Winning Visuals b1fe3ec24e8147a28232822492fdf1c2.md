# Painting a Mosaic - Designing Winning Visuals

Make sure to always have at least 3 visuals per message (pictures, videos, etc...). This ties back into making sure that you give the Facebook algorithm the variety it needs to iterate and potentially be successful. 

The Facebook algorithm is an iteration algorithm. You need to continually be giving it new content and to be testing so that you have a better chance of being prioritized on high quality audience traffic. 

A minimum rule of thumb is 3 visuals per message and 5 messages per ad-set. This leads to 15 different combinations for the algorithm to process and test.

**THE MORE YOU TRY AND TEST THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO SUCCEED.**

2. Visuals should look native or semi native 
    1. Look like a social media post - interesting post from an interesting person.
