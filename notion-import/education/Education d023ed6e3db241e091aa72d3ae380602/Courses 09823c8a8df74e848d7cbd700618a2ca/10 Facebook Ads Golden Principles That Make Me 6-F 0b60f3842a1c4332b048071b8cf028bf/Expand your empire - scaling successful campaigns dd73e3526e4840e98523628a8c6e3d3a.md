# Expand your empire - scaling successful campaigns

Facebook is a non-linear growth system. Most advertisers think that doubling a budget will double the results. That's not true. 

4 factors play into the three-day formation period of a campaign:

1. Messages
2. Visuals
3. Audience (based on actions)
4. Budget

Different ad sets in the same audiences are unique and can perform differently. Also, environments change overtime. When an ad set is being optimized during a formation period, it's like a snap shot in time. The time of the month, could be an influence, holidays for example as well. That's always changing, so you need to iterate.

Another issue that advertisers run into is that they start with too small of budget with too few people. The algo then optimizes on this. Then they try to 10x budget and expect results, which don't come through since FB is non-linear.

Also, let's say you have an initial test of reaching 500,000 people. It gets results so you then ad budget and add an activity relevant. That actually reduces you potential audience, as each new variable further segments to audience. 

Once an ad set is done, DON'T change it. Leave everything about it. Duplicate successful elements into new ad sets and campaigns.

### How to expand?

Never move on to the next stage until you have multiple of one working.

Stage 1: Scale via activity segment

Take a successful ad set and duplicate it several or more times, giving each one a slight age and budget variation.

These micro variations make it possible to inch performance systematically in one direction or another to better expand on the initial audience that was working.

Stage 2: Scale via budget segment

Duplicate the ad set and start making increasingly high budget variations.

Facebook prevents you from competing against yourself in bidding.

The goal is NOT to have 20 ad sets all targeting the same audience with variations, the goal is to do that in the beginning and then as the best start to surface begin turning off the others.

Stage 3: Message OR Visual Variations (Never both)

Once you have several ad sets that are working with activity segment variations and then several working with budget segment variations, then you look at variables. 

At this point, you're having success in stage 1 and 2. However, make sure that you ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME. This way, you can isolate what change was responsible for the boost or loss.

Stage 4: Scale via Lookalike Audiences

Rule of thumb, don't do lookalike audiences until you've had at least 1,000 people take the action that you want them to take. This is the opposite of the demographics and activity. This is literally telling Facebook to find people of similar behavior that have gone through your funnel.

Make sure that your audience is of people that are paying customers! If its just traffic, it will just give you lookalike traffic audiences.

Summary:

Duplicate ad sets that are successful WHILE they are successful. Max them out in their current environment with stepped variations. And then keep duplicating them.
