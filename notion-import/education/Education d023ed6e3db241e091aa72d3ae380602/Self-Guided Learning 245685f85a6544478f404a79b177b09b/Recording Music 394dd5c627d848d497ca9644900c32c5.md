- It's extremely important that the headphones you wear while recording vocals allow you to hear yourself singing in the room, as well as through the headphones.
- Room noise is not a bad thing, in comparison to isolated sound.
- When using a metronome click, DO NOT use a click that has tone in it, as this can throw off your pitch and recording.
- Use a non-tone Click on metronome so it blends in with the percussion

### Using Compression

- When recording vocals it's ideal to create an auxiliary track that has Compression and EQ on it so that the RECORDED TRACK ends up being more balanced and consistent.
- To create a new Aux Track in Pro Tools:
    - Create new audio track
    - Send signal to a *Bus* (any number). This will create a new Aux track.
    - You then can get rid of the Bus (not the track) and the new Aux track will stay.
    - What you can then do is set an input for the Aux track and then send the signal to the Audio track.
        - Input to Aux Track → Output to Bus (#) → New Track for that Bus will be created → Set Audio Input to "Bus # → Aux #"
    - Now set your plugins on the Aux track so that the recorded track is pre-filtered
