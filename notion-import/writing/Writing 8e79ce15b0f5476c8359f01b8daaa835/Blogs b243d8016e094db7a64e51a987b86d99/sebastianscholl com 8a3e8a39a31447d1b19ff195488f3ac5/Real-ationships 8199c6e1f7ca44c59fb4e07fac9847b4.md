A few weeks ago I got a new job as a real estate sales agent and have quickly realized that there are eleven parallelsÂ to be drawn, and lessons to be learned between selling real estate and relationships....enjoy.

1. "If one out of one-hundred works out...that's still pretty good"
2. "Not everyone wants to see your apartment"
3. "It's easier to approach girls, because I'm so much more used to rejection"
4. "Sometimes you have to convince them what matters is on the inside"
5. "Using the word "unit" to describe anything sounds dirty"
6. "You'll never find a perfect match, but try convincing others so"
7. "Set your expectations low until you've seen it"
8. "Sometimes you have to convince them what matters is on the outside..."
9. "It all depends upon a person budget"
10. "Once their moved in it's hard to get them out"**11**"Sometimes they look way better in pictures"
