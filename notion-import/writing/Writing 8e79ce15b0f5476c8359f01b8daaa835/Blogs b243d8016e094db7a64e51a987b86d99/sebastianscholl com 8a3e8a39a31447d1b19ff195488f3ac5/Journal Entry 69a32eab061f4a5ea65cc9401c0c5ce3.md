Yesterday we met John and John(Murphy) who did the cinematography and production management for Travel Channels Dangerous Grounds. Murphy did NYU film school, and John Syracuse for communications. He was in a Jam band, thinks he should have stuck with it, and also did a second degree and half of his masters in Buffalo.

Murphy had the crazy story of Ziplining in Belize and getting stuck half way over the thousand foot gorge. And had also flipped the car in Colombia and been through Nepal, all for Dangerous Grounds. - lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn.

John had work on tons of shows from MTV to Discovery. Most likely extremely connected in the TV production industry - lives in Manhattan on Bleaker and Broadway, but spends most free time in Denver with his girlfriend who works in the financial industry there.

**Nordic Approach - Norway**

Tim Wendelboe, funded by Solberg & Hansen (which is the biggest oil company in Norway) won early world champion barista competition. Started Tim Wendelboe roaster in Norway, one of best known names in the industry.

**Process**

Coffee is depulped, then left to ferment so that the muscilage become detached from the parchment so that it can be easily washed off afterwards. One of the most skilled positions at a traditional coffee farm is controlling the fermentation stage, some of which calls for the addition of enzymes.

Traditionally doing this consumes a lot of water and a lot of waste.

Aqua pulping is relatively new and is pretty much a washer machine for the coffee that reuses the same water, forcing off the mucilage through pressure.

Joe found that the naturally fermented Coffee had more depth, brightness, and acidity - compared to the aqua pulped coffees. But he still went ahead and aqua pulped. (Almost all of panama switched to aqua pulp)

As buyer you're worried about te Coffe age. As an exporter they just ship.

**Traditional coffee processing** is pulping, natural fermentation, and wash.

Natural Process: 25-30 days in Red Room for Perci and Perci Red

W Category: wash everything off before drying

H Category: some mucilage on before drying

N Category: full cherry before drying

**Talk with Joe**

While loading the kiln with samples for the travel channel Joe and I talked about indoor growing. Moving to a city like Detroit and taking over abandoned buildings to convert them into massive green house operations. Joe said it is feasible, and that at the current boutique price of coffee you could pay American wages to produce the crop,

It be best to import Volcanic soil, and some reaserch would have to be done at the Coffee research center in Costa Rica (Catie ~ Coffee Research Center).

**Coffee Roasting**

After putting the coffee in the drum, you need to let airflow in which will allow the drum to cool slightly and then heat back up with the coffee. Between minutes 6 and 8 you should hear the "first crack". It sounds like popcorn. At that point the coffee become exothermal, meaning certain reactions are producing their own energy. So at this point you drop down the incoming energy to almost one fourth of what it was. And over the next two or so minutes you let it cool. HOWEVER, you never want the coffee to drop in tempurature ~ just the drum. The coffee should be rising in tempurature by approximately 1-degree ever 3 or 4 seconds. The total roasting time should last between 8 to 10 minutes.
