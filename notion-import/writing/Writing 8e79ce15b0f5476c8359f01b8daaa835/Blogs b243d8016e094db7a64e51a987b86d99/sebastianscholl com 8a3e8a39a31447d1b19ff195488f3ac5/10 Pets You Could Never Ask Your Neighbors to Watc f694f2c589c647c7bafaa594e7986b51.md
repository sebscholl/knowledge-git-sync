Once again, writers block.  However, today I did see a really, really ugly dog.  And I thought to myself, "if that thing was mine, no one would EVER take care of it for a few days if I ever had to do something."  This got me thinking, and I started brain storming all the crazy pets a person could have that literally no one would ever be willing to take care of.  Here is a list of those bizarre pets:

## 1) Aye-Aye

"Hey! Would you mind taking care of my Aye-Aye for the weekend?"

## 2) Snakefish

"Bob, could you do me a favor and feed my Snakefish? He loves company."

## 3) Gumprecht's Green Pit Viper

"Bro, I gotta head out of town for a few days. Mind if I drop off my Gumprecht's Green Pit Viper?"

## 4) Giant Leaf Tailed Gecko

"Dude, I told my Giant Leaf-Tailed Gecko that he may be living with you this weekend and he look STOKED"

## 5) Angler Fish

"Hey Man, heard your powers out - sucks - want to borrow my Angler Fish while hit the country for a few days?"

## 6) Tree Kangaroo

"It's just for a few nights. Plus, it's a Tree Kangaroo, and your kid loves Pokemon!"

## 7) Muta Muta Mutant Turtle

"C'mon bud, please. My Mata Mata Mutant Turtle has only killed someone, like, twice."

## 8) Yoda Bat

"Seriously? It's just a Fruit Nose Bat - just NEVER feed him after midnight, no matter how much he screams."

## 9) Polar Bear

"Please? It's just a polar bear - we shave him so he doesn't shed!"

## 10) Don't even want to look up its name - just WOW

If this was your dog...I simply doubt you'd have friends to ask.
