It's rare that I repost other's work.  These pictures are so exceptional though I couldn't not share them.

DeMilked.com is a design "milking" magazine.  Pretty much, they scour the web for industrial design, technology, concepts, advertising and web design content that they can feature on their website and in their newsletters.  I highly recommend subscribing the their newsletter [here](http://www.demilked.com/) - it is my absolute favorite!

In todays subscription email they featured portraits by [photographer Jimmy Nelson](http://www.beforethey.com/) - who has become widely recognized for his “Before They Pass Away” photo compilation.  Over the past two years Nelson has photographed as many of these tribes as he could access, and has produced some absolutely breathtaking imagery from his efforts.  What particularly grabbed me in his work is the uniqueness of each tribe.  The photos seem as though they weren't taken on earth, but instead are scenes from the most adventurous fiction novels and films...Enjoy!
