Regalia - Limited Edition Living, is the coolest development being constructed in Sunny Isles and arguably the whole of Miami Beach - that is unless you're impressed by the Porsche Design building that is going up just a block away.  The Regalia has one apartment per floor...yes, in each apartment you have a 360 degree balcony.  The lowest floors' price is advertised at $6,500,000, but then tack-on an additional $35,000 for each of the 40 levels you go up - bringing the penthouse in at $15,500,000.

To top it all off, Regalia sports its own billiards room, ocean view yoga room, and library.

**Regalia building amenities:**

- Large infinity edge pool set amidst lush gardens and fountains
- Spa and fitness center overlooking the Atlantic, with yoga room
- Oceanfront gazebo with shower and spa
- Private beachfront cabanas
- Library
- Billiard Room
- Lounge
- Media Room
- Business Center
- Valet
- Concierge

My roommate John and I just happened to be in town during - and invited to - the Regalia's cocktail party.  No lie, it was fun to feel important while sales agents trained as bizarrely seductive foreign women.... casually implied offering their affection in exchange for my falsely perceived millions.  Despite my hair, the photographer snapped a picture of us for the World Red Eye - Visual Celebrity Lifestyle Journal.  Unsuprisingly, there were no celebrities.

If only we had been invited to the party on our own merit!
