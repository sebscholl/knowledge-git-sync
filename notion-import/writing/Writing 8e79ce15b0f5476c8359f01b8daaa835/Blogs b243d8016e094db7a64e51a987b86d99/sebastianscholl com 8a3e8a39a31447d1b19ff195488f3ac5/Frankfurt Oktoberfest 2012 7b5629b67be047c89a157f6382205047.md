So last Tuesday afternoon, I was lounging on my couch when the idea popped into my head "I should go to Frankfurter Oktoberfest".  Stuffing my backpack with a few clothes, running to the airport to hitch the next flight and texting my teachers I'll be sick this...and maybe next week..Thursday morning I landed in Frankfurt.

Now maybe it was a little more preplanned, maybe I packed a full suitcase, maybe I got to the airport early from excitement and maybe all my teachers know about my trip...however regardless of the unknowns I did land in Frankfurt Thursday morning...Güten Morgen Deutschland!

Here are a few pictures from my first few evenings at Frankfurter Oktoberfest.  I will be composing a proper post detailing my experience during my flight home next week, but here are a few pictures I liked thus far.

Gina Lisa made it to one of the final rounds of Germany's Next Top Model in early 2012 and has gained much fame due to it.  To me, she just seems like she is full of potential and has a lot to offer.

Anya (blanking on her last name...) won last years German Bachelorette TV show.

I never thought I'd dress like this and THEN fit in...and for that Bavaria, I thank you.

Just a bar.

I hope someone in the crowds name was Waldo....

....and his friends lost him.

Kai's youngest son Jean'Remy (Kai started and runs Frankfurter Oktoberfest and allowed me to stay with him for my trip)

I've completely forgot their names.

Plain young me.

It is not a big deal, I'm only on stage.

Now this is quality torture...instead of a competition racing to chug your Liter beer (YES, THE BEERS COME IN LITER GLASSES), they see who can hold the 3Kg beer in front if them the longest.  Kai is hosting on the right.

Right: Niko, supposedly he is a reality TV star who won a show similar to Survivor.  We didn't get to talk to long...but that's what others told me.

Left: Niko's manager Volker Gruber.

I thought a pork leg would give me the fuel I needed to push through the day...but it ended up being the weight I subconsciously wanted to force me to retire for an afternoon.

Hope you enjoyed the pictures.  I'm assuming i'll have enough video to put together a few minutes of footage later... but all in good time.

Yesterday I had the opportunity to meander around the city of Frankfurt for about 8 hours.  When coming here I was under the impression that I'd be staying in Frankfurt, when actually I am staying in Oberthousen, which would be as though saying you're in NYC when you're in Brooklyn.

From finance to retail to restaurants and a red-light district, Frankfurt is a complete and compact city.  Similar to Boston in that walking is an easy way to get anywhere, though cabs are faster.  I can't really tell if the people are friendly though...because even a German saying hello sounds threatening.  But for the most part I was able to use all sign language besides the middle finger to navigate my day.

(At this beautifully designed, 5 story, shopping mall the glass caves in through the building, up over the roof and down to the ground floor)

Young students and professionals stormed the street throughout the day, shopping, dining and keeping busy.  Street performers, drunkards and the homeless played a minor roll in the busy streets, however this street performer below easily caught my attention.

(The coolest way I've ever seen to just get paid by sitting around all day!)

It took me about 20 blocks before I could find a restaurant with a good salad...one more pretzel or beer and I might explode.  The food is awfully heavy here...which is something that only ever really bothers me...maybe Texas students would feel at home.

This is cool.

At Oktoberfest last Saturday night I was introduced to Antonia Fuchs.  She was working at the festival as a Drunk Patrol (a very cool job I've not yet seen in the states), though we stepped outside for a bit and small talked.  Exchanging numbers after a flimsy promise that she'd show me the town during my trip, we said goodbye and both went back to our responsibilities.  The next day I text messaged her asking what her weeks scheduled looked like, and she responded by inviting me to a musical she'd be attending in Köln.

![http://mynamessebastian.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/1059d-photo-13.jpg](http://mynamessebastian.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/1059d-photo-13.jpg)

(The Cats tent from outside)

Köln is about 180 miles from Frankfurt...but on the German roads thats only a hour and a half drive!  (speed limits aren't really...important)  The following day she picked me up, we took our short road trip and soon arrived at the theater.  Everything was fun and simple up to this point, but here is what I didn't know...

![http://mynamessebastian.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/4e104-photo-11.jpg](http://mynamessebastian.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/4e104-photo-11.jpg)

(The performance stage)

Antonia was an actress on a popular German soap-opera and had been invited to this Musical as a celebrity guest because it was the premier after being redone by the same director of Phantom of the Opera, Starlight Express...ect.  We showed up, received free tickets from her manager, as well as VIP wristbands for the after party.

![http://mynamessebastian.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2a24f-photo-12.jpg](http://mynamessebastian.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2a24f-photo-12.jpg)

(Inside the tents front room)

The tent, was awesome.  Black canvas, red carpets, black suits and champaign rain, this was the closest I've been to feeling as though I'm in a James Bond Movie.  Hors d'œuvres trays with choices from Salmon wraps to mousse were scurried around by the servers while bartenders were relieved from the responsibility of collecting payment.  Not knowing German, my job was to stand next to Antonia with a pleasant smile, my payment, endless Champaign.  Fortunately smiles and laughter are universal because they soon became my only method of communication.

(Antonia and myself at the after party)

Sadly, I may have been the only person there that paparazzi weren't trying to capture, however a few cocktails later I could have cared less.  The experience was one that I'll be wanting to recreate going forward, though anticipate mild success in that realm!  Regardless, this was just another detour that has made my Germany experience exceptional.

(Antonia and myself in-front of the musicals poster)

Oh...the musical was mediocre...I'm no critic...but I'd not watch it again unless there was another after-party.

When Blogging, I often want to post about experiences I haven't thoroughly internalized.  Germany was blur, and the day post return I'm antsy to write about the trip...therefore, if this post seems unorganized, it is due to me not having sufficient time to...think it out.

(This is my video of the trip.  Hopefully it will make up for todays writing.  After watching my video on YouTube I realized that there was some significant quality loss in the upload...as well as some audio blips...soorryyy

Here is a VIMEO LINK THAT IS HIGHER DEFINITION: [https://vimeo.com/50488239](https://vimeo.com/50488239))

(Frankfurt financial district)

I'm not an introvert.  I may even be so bold to say that I have friends.  However often my best memories are ones of being alone.  Relationships of all sort are beautiful distraction, but distractions none the less.  The most effective way for me to learn and relax is unencumbered by companionship.  Wondering a foreign city, gazing on a beach, navigating a river or ascending a mountain, the limited time I'm able to express and explore unbounded by the obligation to interact often prove to be most valuable.

Now you might be utterly confused on why I mentioned this in my Germany post.  To take all that I just said and put it simply...I enjoy my alone time...I got some alone time in Germany.  Two of the days during my trip I was able to take a half day to enjoy my own company in Frankfurt.  From the tops of Skyscrapers to the basement cafés, I believe accomplished a thorough exploration.

In my past few updates I believe I gave a good impression of how the Oktoberfest ran, and my video (hopefully) picks up the missing pieces.  Here are a few last pictures to finish up the trip, I hope you enjoyed all the updates.

These next three photo's I find to be a funny sequence...below is a picture of myself and a man who's name I unfortunately have forgotten, though you may know!  He is a chef on the Food Network, and recently published two cookbooks in the US.

The Oktoberfest runs a total of 19 days, and hosts one Gay night.  The entertainment was in drag...and the "woman" below was one of the main acts.

Now this is the picture I find funny, and for a simple reason...I'm the only one I know, and probably you know, who has a picture of himself with two transvestites and a celebrity chef.

The older woman in this picture owns BB Bar in Frankfurt and runs the champagne bar at Oktoberfest...she ran a very popular brothel when she was younger before opening the bar/club.

I went to the Stadel Museum...and like this piece...

If you look at the first picture in this post you will see a few tall buildings. The blue glass cylinder one holds a observation deck and restaurant on its top floors.  I took a good hour to sit, enjoy a drink and snack while admiring the view.

This picture was taken with my GoPro, it unfortunately doesn't have the clearest image, but I really liked the stage and crowd divide.

That's really all I have....
