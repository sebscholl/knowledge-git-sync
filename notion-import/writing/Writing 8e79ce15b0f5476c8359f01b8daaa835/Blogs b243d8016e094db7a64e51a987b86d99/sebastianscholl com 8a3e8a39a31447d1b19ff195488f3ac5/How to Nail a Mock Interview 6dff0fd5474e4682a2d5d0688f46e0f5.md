Lets define the word *mock*:

*Mock as a verb*: "tease or laugh at in a scornful or contemptuous manner"

*Mock as an adjective*: "not authentic or real, but without the intention to deceive"

In order to graduate my school requires that a student completes two **mock** interviews.  They encourage that you pursue opportunities that would require **real** interviews.  However, the mock interviews are considered an integral part of our highly regarded "work experience" requirement.

There are a few ways to complete the mock interview - and I chose the online option.  The instructions were to listen to the questions, take 30 seconds to prepare an answer, and then respond accordingly.  And that is **EXACTLY** what I did.

Here is the thing... it was a **mock** interview, and there was no way I would have been able to sit in a bedroom and take this assignment seriously.  So, I decided to mock the interview - as well as screen capture the the whole thing.  I cut the video down to 6-minutes from 15, which is still long...but I hope you enjoy it.

Also...there was no company or industry that the interview pertained to.....

Happy Super Bowl Sunday!
