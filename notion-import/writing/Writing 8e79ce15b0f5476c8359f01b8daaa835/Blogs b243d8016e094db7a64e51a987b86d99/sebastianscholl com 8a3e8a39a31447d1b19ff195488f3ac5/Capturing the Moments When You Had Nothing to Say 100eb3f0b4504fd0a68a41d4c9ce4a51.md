It's difficult to articulate moments in which you had nothing to say.  Experiences where every element was so well balanced a single word would have disrupted the harmony.  It's rare I come across such moments.  When I do though, my mind becomes consumed with dreaming of ways to share them.

This morning my British literature class was conducted as a class should be.  We walked streets and loitered on curbs of those neighborhoods where the most celebrated authors once lived.  And a name was not mentioned unless it had a tangible meaning to us at that moment.  Being where we were, stories of authors like T.S. Elliot and Virginia Woolf were told while their historical memories loomed like ghosts.

Around noon my friend and I took the tube to Richmond.  Her name's Sarah.  Earlier in the week she spoke to me about the color of the leaves, and that *this* specific area was enchanting.  So enchanting, she wanted to go back.  And I'm too grateful that she invited me.

The impromptu picnic is a favorite of mine.  There are no times where fruit, crackers, and cheese are not enhancements.  Above the bank on a narrowed stretch of the Thames we snacked as colorful boats bobbed in the water that sparkled as magnificent as gold sequin.  An old man sat near us - playing and singing the electric guitar through a radio sounding speaker.  He was calm - and often missed pitches and chords in a way that was endearing and authentic.

He played by himself, except for a back up choir of crying seagulls.  And in-between numbers enjoyed lengthy breaks to smoke long and white cigarets.  There was nothing real about him.  His character was distant from the world but integral to the scene - a scene that held beauty and uniqueness to that of the cracks in a perfectly baked loaf of bread.

If I were to try describing this afternoon to you in person, I would do so with little more than a long sigh.  The stresses that weigh on me every day are ones self inflicted, but even they couldn't find me by the river in Richmond.  Everything felt right.  I hope you enjoy the pictures and short video.
