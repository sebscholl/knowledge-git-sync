Within the last hour two bombs exploded less than a half mile apart at Copley, the Boston Marathon finish line.  As of now it has been reported that there have been many injuries, as well as a few deaths - The Boston Globe figures that there have been "at least a dozen".  The bombs have created a smokey and chaotic scene down by the Prudential Mall area, halting marathon runners in their tracks.  Authorities are evacuating the area and encouraging pedestrians to keep away from the marathon  course.

Hope everyone is safe.
