Yesterday I once again was up at the crack of dawn with the bitter taste of cold brew electrifying my eyes wide open.  Dedicating another day to the learning how to use Blender, I threw on headphones, found as many YouTube tutorials as I could, and became unaware of any world that wasn't being seen through my laptop screen - here is the product.

On my first day using blender I played with manipulating one shape (a cylinder) into an odd but imaginative design, simply pulling and pushing its faces, edges, and vertices in whichever direction I felt urged to.  Now though I wanted to try more of a practical design  and see if I could bring together many shapes into something that is familiar.

After a few hours of play I found myself with a clock.  By stretching, rotating, skewing, and slicing a selection of familiar geometric shapes I was able to bring them together into a hyper-real rendering of an alarm-clock that I find strangely nostalgic.

On the one hand, due to it's gentle shape and color it seems childish and cartoonish.  On the other hand, though, the face is antique like, which makes it hard to distinguish whether it is a relic or a production piece - enough said, I like it.

Upon finishing the clock I took a break to get some food in me and soon began sculpting.  The difference being that with sculpting you're virtually molding clay, where as before that I hand just been manipulating and joining shapes.  Here is what I came up with.

A few months earlier I had dreamed up a design for a wine bottle holder - one of the ones that balance the weight of the bottle in a horizontal V shape - so I decided to try making progress with that.  Once again starting with a long cylinder, I began to scrape, pinch, and pull the virtual clay.

This process is much more time consuming, for the detailing was quite difficult to get used to.  However, I was able to make some progress with the design - at least to where it looks like a forearm and hand, as well as a cool feature I decided to try.

How it works is that the bottles neck is placed into the grip so that the uneven weight of the bottle balances out the tilt of the arm.  Once I get the design finalized though, it will look as though the arm is breaking out of what ever surface it's set on.  Additionally, the two prongs that are seen coming out of the palm provide an area where one may either set or hang their cork-screw.
