After spending a day wasting away in my room on Cromwell road, I decided to go across the road to see the carrousel glow...I could write a poem to accompany these pictures, but I'll spare you - YOU'RE WELCOME.

Ever since arriving in London I've been fairly down on the place - even though I shouldn't be, because I know it's an amazing city...but for whatever reason it just hasn't felt like my city.  So, with only a month left till I return home after a long time away, I've decided to give London a second shot by putting in the extra effort to "make it" my kind of city.

DON'T BE ALARMED, but I've learned that when I'm most happy, I exhibit all the stereotypical behaviors of someone who is suicidal...I spend excessive amounts of time by myself; I over analyze things; I give away the possessions that I believe are important to me; my mood is as variable as the weather; and nine times out of ten I'm intentionally putting myself in danger.

Tonight...the greatest danger I faced was setting my tripod up REALLY, REALLY close to the edge of the road as black taxis wizzed by at like, 25-miles an hour...so yea, not exactly an adrenaline junky's dream.  HOWEVER, I was able to fulfill some of my other favorite criteria.

After recognizing that boredom had crept upon me I took a late night stroll across - the street - to the Natural History Museum of London. A few nights earlier I had seen a carrousel glowing behind the iron gates.  And since then I've been waiting for a cold and clear night to pay a visit with my camera...I don't know why it had to be cold - it just seemed right.

The colors are rich and dim and the gold's luminance enhances the darks.  For the first time in a long time...I"M VERY HAPPY with a shoot.  Carrousels are so fun look at, because they are eerie and beautiful - very exotic in their own way.

# **CLICK ON THE PICTURES TO VEIW THEM IN THEIR FULL RESOLUTION...IT'S NECESSARY.**
