Sometimes the best way to surprise a friend is by attempting to surprise yourself.  That's why after Olivia responded "surprise me", when I asked what she'd like for dinner, I tried to out-do myself. I had always heard about molecular gastronomy cooking as if it were an exotic technique employed by only the most cutting edge chefs.  Never did I know that I'd be playing around with these methods in my own kitchen!

This past Christmas my sister, Sarah, gave me a gastronomy cooking kit that I had put in the closet out of intimidation.  For this dinner, though, I knew that the kit must be opened.  I found the box, blew off the dust, opened it up and felt befuddled by the strange powders and utensils inside.  Here's how it went.

Close up!

Now, for the main course I decided to use no gastronomy techniques.  For a good reason to...I believe. I had no idea if any of this stuff tastes good!  Yeah, it looked cool and sounded exciting.  However, I felt like I was planning a date at an art museum.  What if we didn't like the art?  Therefor, I went back to the basics, and prepared a baked chicken and figs dish with a lemon vinaigrette.  Simply, tasty, safe!
