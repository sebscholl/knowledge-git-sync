I'm a broken man. I don't know what I want from life; and, I'm near the point where life itself isn't of desire. All I know is that the life that I have is not the life that I want. Nor any previous life I've experienced being one I wish to revert to. Another start, or a final end, is all that seems tolerable.

There is an unexplainable connection between language and chemical reaction in the body.

I worked relentless for the first part of my life to gain the intelligence, logos, reasoning that now I use to rationalize myself as being insignificant and absolutely indecisive.
