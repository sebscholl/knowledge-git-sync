My Latest Photoshop Picture, Inspired by the Short Paragraphs Below

To put it lightly, I was a bit of a fiction fanatic growing up.  Raiding my fathers woodshed and turning loose scraps into swords, staffs, armor and treasures permeated my days.  The parents are still in debt from the scads of Duck-tape I stockpiled.  For whether it were a suit of armor or wallet, with Duck-tape, I could make it.

As I aged my fantasy world faded.  Velcro sneakers soon became uncool and self-consciousness would tease me when wearing a cape and carrying a plywood ax through groceries.  My idols that were once archers and swordsmen became musicians, punk rock degenerates who appeared to epitomize rebellion and individualism.  Ironically, even-though aspiring to a subculture infatuated with defiance and aberration, my mentality had become conformist.

Present-day, I fondly drift of in memory to when I anxiously awaited my acceptance letter to Hogwarts, proudly endured the responsibility of carrying the One Ring around me neck, and cast spells at my siblings.  It was those early years to which I attribute infusing me with a life's worth of creativity and passion.  I hope to never misplace those memories, and constantly sweat to keep them alive and vivid.

“Don’t think. Thinking is the enemy of creativity. It’s self-conscious, and anything self-conscious is lousy. You can’t try to do things. You simply must do things”

Ray Bradbury
