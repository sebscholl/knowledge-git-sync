Me overlooking Sicily from a 2000 year old Greek theater.

Pictures can be difficult to take.  Not in a physically exhaustive way (though sometimes it can be) but in an expressionist sense.  I've struggled with this for years now.  And have taken thousands of pictures of beautiful, depressing, mysterious or eery landscapes, objects, and people that simply never look as magical on screen.  It is often disheartening when this happens, and I always thought to myself, "maybe if I bought a better camera/or a more professional lens", but every upgrade was once again a disappointment.

Greek Amphitheater

I may still be wrong, but I think I have found a solution to my problem.  And that is that, "what we see is not always what we are looking at"...let me explain.  When I look down a dark alley in the middle of the night in New York City, I don't see an alley.  I see danger, I see mystery, I see an opportunity to feel courageous, and I see risk.  However, the camera takes a picture of just the alley, not what *you* see.  It often fails to capture the true emotion of what the photography wanted to portray.

Greek Amphitheater

You cannot take a picture of courage or risk, but you can take or manipulate pictures into projecting those emotions.  And that is what I'm now trying to train me eye to recognize - how to take pictures that emphasize the emotions my subjects deliver to me.  Sometimes when walking down the street, I'm overwhelmed by a certain color, where when I take a picture, that magic is taken away by the image showing every color.  Thus, editing is key, and patience with thought is equally important.

The Peripheral

I hope you enjoy these first pictures from Taormina, Sicily.  It is one of the few places I have ever been where everywhere I look, whether that be a cliff into the ocean or a trash bin in a church, is stunning.
