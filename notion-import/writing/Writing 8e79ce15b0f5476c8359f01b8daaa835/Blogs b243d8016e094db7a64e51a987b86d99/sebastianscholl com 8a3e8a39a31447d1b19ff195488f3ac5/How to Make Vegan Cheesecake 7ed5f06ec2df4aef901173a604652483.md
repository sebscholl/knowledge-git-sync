Last February I became a vegetarian.  It was easy.  A month ago I decided to try being vegan.  That...has not been as easy.  I stayed alive my last few weeks in London eating rice, apples, and peanut butter.  And was practically torturing myself to keep away from any animal products.  This is not because being vegan is difficult, it's simply because I wasn't planning properly.

Now I'm back home in Miami, FL and am set on actually figuring out how to eat healthy as a vegan.  And not by just eating raw veggies and nuts, but actually preparing delicious dairy, flesh, egg, and soy (I don't like soy) free foods.

I have two favorite places to eat.  In first place comes [Miami Juice](http://www.miamijuice.com/), Sunny Isles Beach.  And in second place is the [Juice Press](http://www.juicepress.com/), NYC.  While in New York last weekend I made a visit to the Juice Press and had a slice of vegan cheesecake...game over.  I knew at that second I had to move to New York or make it myself.  For now...I'll go with the latter.

**DO IT:**

- 1 1/2 cups - Raw Cashews
- 2 cups - Raw Brazil Nuts
- 1/2 cup - Pitted Medjool Dates
- 1/4 cup - Agave Nectar
- Some... - Shredded coconut
- 1/4 cup - Fresh Lemon Juice
- 6 tbs - Coconut Oil
- 6 tbs - Water
- 3 cups - Blue Berries (or Strawberries)
- Some... - Sea Salt

1) **You need to soak ALL the nuts**.  Get two lidded jars and put about a table spoon of sea salt in each.  Put a little bit of **hot** water in each jar are shake it so that the salt disintegrates before filling the jar about 2/3rds of the way full with **cold** water, and then drop in all the nuts.  They need to sit in the salt water for 4 hours at least (I did 8 hours), so set those aside and find a hobby.

2) **The nuts are soaked.**  Strain the water out of both jars, then throw the brazil nuts and pitted dates into your blender.  Turn the blender on low, and just keep grinding until the dates and nuts have a crumbly texture to them.  This is the crust, so you are NOT making a smoothie.  Once done, sprinkle the shredded coconut into a 8" pie tin (to keep the crust from sticking), and then scrape out the nut/date mixture on top of the coconut and press into a crust shape - place in fridge.

3) **Time for the filling.**  Take EVERYTHING ELSE (cashews, agave, lemon juice, berries, coconut oil, and water) and throw it into the blender (after cleaning it...).  And blend.  Keep blending.  Blend till you cannot wait any longer to taste what you have blended.  And then - if you care to - blend a little longer.  The consistency should be smooth, but like a very, very thick smoothie.  Once done, take that pie crust out of the fridge and pour in the smoothie like batter evenly.  Jiggle it to help it settle, and then throw it into the **freezer**....DONE.

4) **Feast.**  An hour to two hours later, take the cake out of the freezer, slice it, plate it, and then put it back in the fridge do defrost for a half hour or so.  By now, you should have a perfectly healthy, delicious, and beautiful vegan cheese cake...that you can drizzle more agave nectar on top of if you dare.
