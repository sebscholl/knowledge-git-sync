Important questions to ask oneself the decision-making of anything is whether or not the decision is being influenced by consumer enticed motivators. Is this being sold to you on the basis of want or need? Is this appealing to Gilt, pleasure, or self-improvement?

Also, too often do we consume ourselves and hobbies entertainment that itself contains no other ability the that of inspiring consumer behavior. I believe personally, that a richer life is to be had by avoiding such things to the best of one's ability.
