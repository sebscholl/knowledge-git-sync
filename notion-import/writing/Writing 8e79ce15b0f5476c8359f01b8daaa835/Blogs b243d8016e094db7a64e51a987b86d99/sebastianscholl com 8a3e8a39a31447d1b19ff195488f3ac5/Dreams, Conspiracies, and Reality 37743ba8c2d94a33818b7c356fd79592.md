### Dreams

Last night I had a really, really bizarre dream.   I cannot say it took place in the future, past, or present; however, somehow I had amassed a fortune of around $80,000,000 - cash.  As if I were the Joker from the Batman movie, next to my green mountain I stood in a massive warehouse.  With me was one man, John D. Rockefeller.  I cannot say I've ever met Mr. Rockefeller - or know what he looked like - but I dreamt of him as a tall and properly dressed gent with jet black hair combed to the side and a bushy mustache.  There we stood, side by side with our head tilted back, staring towards the top of the perfectly stacked presidential portraits.

John asked me what I was going to do with the money.  "Enjoy financial freedom" I responded, "now that I have enough money to live on for the rest of my life, I will never have to worry about money again" - he chuckled.  A short breathed laugh that told me he found my answer naive and amusing.  With only a few words he enlightened me, "when did you last worry less about something after acquiring more of it?"  His lesson was obvious, honest, and disheartening - this fortune was going to control me.

Thinking to myself, "the fortune I now control is actually the fortune that controls me", I looked towards John but he was no longer there.  In his place was a short middle aged man whose thick black framed glasses pushed in the sides of his balding head.  He was not a historical figure or someone I knew, but instead the personification of the US Federal Reserve Bank.  From this overweight, dweebish, and uncomfortable looking individual, I was explained how the "system" works.  "The federal reserve controls your money and your money controls you - I control you", he said.

I only remember this because after the dream I woke up and wrote it down - here was my response.

> "Little do you know I relish in the fact that I am your antichrist!  I am the limp in your step, the one who will turn your hairs grey long before they are due.  The value people deem themselves has become found in the currency you control, but not me.  The power you hold is derived from fear, but true power is born in strength.  Fear is for the weak, and that is who you control.  The millions of people who have traded for your passifier their truest freedom; thought.  The only possessions in this world that truly matter are those that have been with me from birth and will follow to death, my body and mind, and I will be damned if I ever allow another or anything to control either of them!"

Then in tyrannical rage, I grabbed a lighter from my pocket and lit the money on fire - laughing as this man burned himself while unsuccessfully trying to save the bundles of cash from the flames.

### Conspiracies

That was my dream, and what a dream it was!  However, there was a reason that this "topic" was troubling my mind.  Last night after cooking a small feast for dinner, I was roped into watching a conspiracy theory documentary pertaining to 9/11.  I had always been aware of these conspiracies, but not necessarily a believer.  This documentary though was, to say the least, convincing.  I will not bore you with the stories, facts, dates, and theories I was so intrigued by last night.  But I will simply state this.

> "Terrorism; Systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective."

In the 12 years it has been since 9/11, acts have been passed by our own government that impede nearly every article on the Bill of Rights, the US government has expanded dramatically, the military as well, and individual privacy has become irrelevant.

### Reality

Earlier today in class I was asked by a classmate if I had read the New York Times this morning.  Please note, most kids my age complain about news on Twitter being cumbersome.  So if I'm asked by a peer if I'm privy to what's in the NYT...probably worth the time finding out.  Pulling out my phone I immediately opened the website to find the top story,[U.S. Is Secretly Collecting Records of Verizon Calls](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/us/us-secretly-collecting-logs-of-business-calls.html)(Click the title to read).

In summary, there is a section of the Patriot Act that allows the US Government to collect meta data (such as phone numbers or call time lengths) which is a largely debated due to it being unconstitutional.  For the past several years - as far as we know - the Obama administration has been secretly carrying out a domestic surveillance program where it has been collecting business communications records that involve Americans.  They did so under the mentioned section of the patriot act.

I'm sure more information will come out, and now it may be to soon to draw concrete conclusions.  However, as quoted in the article from a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr.

> "there is now a significant gap between what most Americans think the law allows and what the government secretly claims the law allows. This is a problem, because it is impossible to have an informed public debate about what the law should say when the public doesn’t know what its government thinks the law says."
