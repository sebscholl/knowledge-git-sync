I told a handful of folks that I was to drive up to Lake Placid. My father had asked me to meet him there, and a dear family friend had invited us as their guests. Every response came as a sort of panic. “You’re kidding?”, “Miami to Lake Placid?” It was only after the first encounter that both parties had learned something new - I that there is a Lake Placid, New York, and them that one also exists in Florida.

From Miami it takes little more than two hours of reckless driving to get you there. And the highway cuts remarkably straight through the sugar cane fields and swamp. Straight in a way that can have you believe you’re making no progress, as the only distinguishable milestone is the horizon, and it never does get closer. After a hundred miles or so forward you find yourself in lake country. A wonderful environment that Florida is home to yet few people acknowledge.

Our dear family friend(s) is the Fay family. Several of my childhood summers were spent vacationing with the Fays' in Melbourne (and again the confusion…Melbourne, FL) learning to skim board, surf, and be beat down by the ocean waves. I’d accredited the time I spent with them for having cultivated in me a love for the ocean. One where no matter how crisp my skin burnt or sore my body felt, I rather swim than recover.

The Fays’ have a very unique claim to fame. Like father like son, like mother like daughter - they are the only family around in which the whole family is sponsored for competitive wake-boarding. Dedicating a month of each summer at the lake, and countless weekends, each one of them can turn heads when trailing behind the boat.

It was a relaxing way to spend several days, before rushing off to the airport - which is where I am now. Monsoon rains hit my plane moments before boarding, affording me a bit more time in Miami’s charming international airport…

I hope you enjoy the pictures. Updates from The World Coffee Expo in Rimini, Itally, and adventures in Athens, Greece will be coming soon.

Growing up I was unaware of the constant struggle I wresteled socially of trying to distinguish myself as not being an amusement. Making the oddities and quirks which made myself me seem as though they were me, and not oddities and qwirks that were independent factors that latched onto me and made the amusement that I believed I was.
