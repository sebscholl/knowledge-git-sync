Ninja approach, make the worst case scenario okay in your head, so that you're not concerned about it and can focus on the task at hand. Ross Edgley

As guys...we fall into this weird mode of justifying a relationship based on how a girl feels about us; NOT how we feel about a girl. So even when we're un-happy, we allow ideas like "she loves me so much" and "she says we're perfect for one another" to hold together relationships we fundamentally don't believe in. Unless you too feel confident, comfortable, and fulfilled personally with your partner, the relationship is one sided and your not being authentic to yourself."

Album title "Dinner Party"

Sitting at the head of a table, mirrors are in every other chair. They need to be angled so that the reflection is there, or have me photoshopped into each one.

A man at Saint Peters Gates arguing for his only good deed

Never again will I be a fool in love, but instead he who is loved by fools.
