The old saying “he puts his pants on one leg at a time, just like you” is a solid truism. However, when it comes to the people we admire most, it's all too easy to become enamored and believe them to be an exception. A symptom of such being that every known idiosyncrasy of theirs becomes a topic of fierce debate. Guided by a holy grail like crusade to discover *what’s their secret.*

We've all heard the question asked before. “What does a day in your life look like? Tell us what it is like to be you.” The information that ensues gets meticulously dissected by an audience in search of advice that's actionable. Though the many patterns align so similarly along the same lines from a macroscopic view; wake, work, eat, and sleep.

So, what details do we end up latching onto? People’s routines. We hear that *he* wakes up to meditate at 6:00am every morning or that *she* trained herself to function on only five-hours of sleep. Rather than accepting such idiosyncrasies as the tangential habits expectedly practiced by over achieving type-As, they're misinterpreted as tributaries to the Nile.

I'm well read when it comes to the genre of personal growth and development. There's a wealth of literature promising specific behaviors to lead a person to success. Such theories are all flawed. There are not specific behaviors that lead to success, but success that often leads to specific behavior. Cause and effect are not interchangeable in this instance.

There’s no meditation schedule, sleep diet, normal diet, wardrobe change, office layout, lifestyle product, lifestyle adaptation or combination of the aforementioned that actualizes success. In pursuit of whatever you deem *success*, don't let such things become distractions. We're all impenetrable messes of needs, goals, and insecurities. Most all of our habits, routines, and idiosyncrasies are consequential manifestations of that composite. Especially for those who dare to get out of bed each morning absent marching orders.

When the opportunity appears to interact with and learn from someone you admire, don't waste it trying to discover *what they do.* More likely than not your schedules and interests will be alike. Instead, focus on understanding how they think. If anything, that is safely their *secret.*
