When feeling like gold with no where to go

I recommend trying Death & CO.

An ominous wooden door

leading to pitch black,

though beyond the curtain

your taken back.

Musty dim light

settling across the room,

"clinking" cocktails,

faint hints of perfume.

The crowd is mellow

engaged in their drinks,

an exotic menu that takes patience to read.

Honey Agave Syrup, cucumber  infused

mescal mixed drinks muddled till smooth.

Here you don't order a jack and coke,

instead choose your spirit

and let the mixologist go.

The whole experience lets you feel "in the know".

A hidden gem where no passerby goes.

An intimate setting for a drink with friends.

I look forward to going

again and again.

The first sentence I thought of rhymed...so I went with it.  HOWEVER, it was a killer spot.  Location, crowd, decor, drinks and service all came together for a memorable experience.  Definitely worth visiting whenever you're near!

I was able to try two drinks while there.  The first, a Prima China (seen in the menu above) and the second a Dangerous Liaison, a whiskey drink featuring house made honey agave syrup and other tantalizing flavors.  My group was unfortunately in a rush to our next destination; however, I'm looking forward to experiencing the rest of the menu.
