I sat down today to write. It has been so long, I did so with an assumption that there must be “something” worth recording. Maybe even profound, that only in the absence of activity could have steadily surfaced. Spoiler alert, there wasn’t.

For longer than I’m comfortable to admit was I staring at the blinking cursor. Both my mind and fingers choked, or in too much of a disagreement to work together. Either way, I’ll never publish this, so here goes nothing.

I ask myself everyday whether my marriage was a mistake. Knowing the answer, which is there is no right answer. The marriage is and will always be exactly what I make of it. Some days I reflect the worst of my being into. Sometimes I reflect the best of my being into it. All the time I’m unsure and frustrated about something, while in parallel feeling reassured of… I don’t know what. Subconsciously I believe I have the upper hand in the relationship, though I can’t define what that means. Something to do with my ego, certainly.

There’s a deep curiosity I hold regarding whether she feels the same way. When she says “I love you”, is it to express how she feels or fight what she feels. For the past few months, I haven’t been saying it. Simply because I don’t feel it. Or maybe I don’t recognize that I feel it. Is there a difference?

Is my calloused attitude one of maturity or indifference? Are my efforts to help rooting in caring or distraction? Why do I feel so fucking obligated? Is that love or obsession?

Do I hate myself, and have allowed a partner to distract from addressing that? Hate’s a strong word, though I am comfortable saying that I likely wouldn’t be my own friend.

I am primally hateful. I recognize that. Where does it stem from? I’m going to explore that, without any concern for elegance.

Mom, I fucking hate you. My contempt outweighs my love. Though the only love I maintain for you is that which allows myself to feel human. As a boy, you made decisions about my childhood that were ideologically selfish. Robbing my of both experiences and roll models that a man should receive. You routinely placed me in circles defined by the worthless and pathetic character that is modern femininity. Despite signs I retrospectively recognize in myself of acting out in rebellion to those toxic environments, you were too wrapped up in your own fucked up theology. So my so that it blinded you from seeing the tell tale signs coming from those who you believed your own ideas were best serving.

You removed your boys from there father, for years. The entire time, speaking poorly of him in front of us, treating him poorly in front of us, and abusing the resources he provided you at every opportunity proudly as we watched. I will never respect you for that reason, and I do not respect you for that reason.

I consider your confidence falsely deserved. You waste your intelligence on conspiracy and dogma. You enforce militantly on others all things your too lazy to enforce upon yourself. You act ungratefully, markedly under the assumption that those around you are yours to utilize by your instruction as you see fit. You’re obsession with control, of everything, seemingly stems from you utter lack of engagement with anything which would make you responsible to others.

Blame and resentment are not tied, though often correlated. I resent you for everything that I just said. That said, I do not blame you for how it has affected me. My problems are my own to deal with. I hate the many different bullies that emotionally humiliated me throughout my upbringing. I do not blame them for how their actions impacted me. Everything in life that I end up perceiving is mine to interpret. The is no historical ledger more impactful as the emotions with which our experiences left us.

I see myself as a complete and utter failure. An imposter. Propped up by those who, by motives I question, want something for me. Playing in an arena where others purchased my ticket in.

I don’t know who is here on their own accord. I don’t know, generally, why I respect the people I do respect - or don’t respect the people I don’t respect. I’m seemingly valueless, guided only by the childish emotions of pain and pleasure I experience in reaction the my impact with what’s down stream.

I, by myself, for myself, must find a path out of this cyclical and mental hellhole.
