**Banana Pancakes:**

I need to recap the coffee conversations I had with Joe yesterday. But first, here is the Banana Pancake recipe his Mom made us for breakfast this morning.

- 1 Banana
- 2 Eggs
- Pinch of Salt
- Coconut Oil

**Instructions:** 

1) Mash up the Banana. 

2) Beat the egg to one consistency and throw in a pinch of salt. 

3) Mix the two together and whip smooth. 

4) Coconut oil on a pan and put the mixture on a pancake like shape over heat (covered). 

5) Cook till the top looks a bit dry, or flip with a large spatula. 

6) Use honey instead of maple syrup.

**Ninety Plus Gesha Estates:**

Yesterday during our hike I began rounding off questions. Here are some facts I learned:

- For Gesha, 1 tree per 5-sq meters is the healthy spacing. That equals 2000 trees per 10,000 sq. meters. Many countries crowd their trees for higher production, squeezing as many as 6000 trees into that same region.

- The Ngobe are the indigenous people who live and work here. The are nomadic, coming in for the harvest season. A large hurdle for NP to over come is training them into skilled labor who can follow his untraditional harvest and processes methods.

- Certain tree varieties are best grown amongst the coffee because they grow fast and quickly grow large (shady) leaves. The one pointed out to me as optimal bears the same fruit from which Ricin toxin is produced.

- In these mountainous regions, not all plots are created equal. Some pitches are growing coffee almost on cliffs and others flat. While this does effect water drainage, it is mainly sun and wind exposure that will either make or break a coffee tree.

- Some healthy Gesha trees will already bear fruit by year two, which is harvestable. However, full maturity comes in about year 5 - from which you can enjoy full harvest.

**Story:**

It’s a lot like drug dealing - I imagine. Rushing to sort, weigh, and bag $100,000’s worth of product while deep within a jungle. The only guarantees being a series of handshakes. That all happened midday though. The morning began with Banana pancakes.

After breakfast we went on a hike. It was only a few hundred yards in distance, but took at least a good half hour in maneuvering. Ratibor, a local fourth generation coffee farmer, led the way through the thick forest growth. Almost no step was taken without several machete hacks preceding it. However, we weren’t wondering aimlessly - we were looking for something.

Ratibor’s 90-year old father had recently remember something. A freshwater spring that came up so strong people mistook it for a creek. It came straight from the mountain just a few hundred yards from where the highway had been built. None of us, including Ratibor, had seen it before.

Covered in dirt, bark, bugs, moss, and mud, we pushed our way up the steep pitch - walking directly up the “creek” bed when rocks permitted it. It was long before we heard the cascading sound, and not much longer after that were we drinking from the hillside. Clean as crystal, it could have been bottled at the source.

Hydrated, we made our way back down. And once in the car headed over to the Finca Hartmann coffee farm - Ratibor’s property. He and the twenty people who make up his family all live here, and I’d like to tell you a story of what kind of man his father was.

When Ratibor was a young boy the farm dogs were disappearing. A jaguar was hunting them…successfully. His father worried the jaguar was a danger to the children, so he grabbed Ratibor, a gun, some rope, a flashlight and headed into the forest.

After a bit of time spent tracking a jaguar, they came across a half eaten dog, which was what his old man was looking for. He tied one end of the rope to the carcass, the other two his ankle, climbed high up into the nearest tree with Ratibor, and waited.

Ratibor held the flashlight, his father the gun. And sure enough, deep into the night he felt a tug at his ankle. And Ratibor quickly clicked the flashlight on.

That jugar now lives above their fire place.

The Ngobe people are the indigenous people of Panama, and seasonally migrate to and from the coffee farms for work. While the men work the fields, the women sort the beans - at least this is what I’ve witnessed.

Through a proprietary production process, Joseph produces a extremely sought after type of coffee that turns red when still un-roasted. It must be picked out from the green coffee, but the labor is well worth the time…depending on the quality, it can sell for a low of $150 per pound to $600.

*6:15pm: The Hot Springs

This is a majestic place - truly. Roaring howler monkeys and howling coyotes are heard signing across the valleys while rainclouds race down the mountain sides to water the forest in a surprisingly on timely manner. Once night set in, we jumped in a natural hot spring pool just next to the farm. And as the sunlight disappeared allowing fire flies to take over the night shift, bats could be made out swarming above against the dim colored sky.
