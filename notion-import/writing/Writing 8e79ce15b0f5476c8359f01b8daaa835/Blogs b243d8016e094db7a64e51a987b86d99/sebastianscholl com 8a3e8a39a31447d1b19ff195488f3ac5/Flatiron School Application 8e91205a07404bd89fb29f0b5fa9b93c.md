**In 140 characters or less, tell us what makes you unique***

Until age 15, I never saw a classroom. Education was travel. Extended visits from Tibet to Mexico, learning about our world, from our world.

**Why are you applying to the Flatiron School? ***

Into my third year of college I founded a mobile app startup. Well, I tried to found a mobile app startup. It was called Bazaar, and the vision was to offer a mobile shopping experience that rooted itself in discovery – not search. A young entrepreneur with experience in creative design and marketing, all I needed was my unicorn engineer.

Months flew by while establishing every document and resource I imagined Bazaar might need. Brand guides, marketing campaigns, promotional materials, student ambassadors, incorporation fillings and some seed capital from an angel investor. Everything was moving forward except the actual product, Bazaar.

My rationalization was this; “I’m the businessman. Someone else has to be the developer”. How did I project their cost? Simple, their well deserved fair share of nothing - 20%, 30%, maybe 40% of my “big idea”.

What now in hindsight was clearly the inevitable did quickly happen. My unicorn never appeared. The hype I’d created quickly diminished as people realized that *hype* was all Bazaar was. Those who had committed either time or money receded. It was then that I realized that had even two developers kicked down my door, one being the world’s worst and one the best, I didn’t even have enough of a technical understanding to tell them apart.

Graduation being only a few months away, I traded my pursuit of running a company out of school for a job opportunity in the coffee industry and spent the following year traveling between Panama City, Miami, Athens, and Shanghai documenting the business and lifestyle of an industry leading specialty coffee producer. This eventually led to a coffee sales role in Brooklyn through a series of spontaneous decisions. And while living on a very tight budget there, my next startup idea came to me.

Five Dollar Feast would be the proletariat’s Zagat. A tool for equipping the young and cheap tight for information needed to eat out and drink affordably. Rapidly I grew my social media following to 3000+, as well as built a website that featured an interactive map displaying all of the “Feast Joints”. Very quickly though it became clear to me that the Five Dollar Feast concept wasn’t a website, it was an app - and I wasn’t going to let history repeat itself.

I discovered the rapid development kit Good Barber and built Five Dollar Feast’s first release. Soon after, several hundred people were using the mobile app, and I wanted to make new updates. Good Barber offered a limited selection of very specific customization tools, yet I discovered several simple hacks after learning some html/css on Codecademy.

My hacks worked, but created an inconsistent user experience across different mobile devices. I felt stumped, and decided to use an education stipend offered by my current employer to enroll in night school at General Assembly to take their 3-month Front-End Web Development course. Within the first week, I’d prodded my teachers with enough questions to piece together a disparate knowledge of JavaScript and write a program I needed.

Once again, I felt Good Barber’s constraints when it didn’t allow me to include my own executable files. And with that, two things became clear to me. 1) Developing Five Dollar Feast the *right* way would mean developing it from scratch, and 2) nothing excited me more than waking up early, as well as leaving work, every day to go code.

With my General Assembly course ending in early January, I want to run with the momentum I’ve gained and further push myself in a more challenging learning environment. In doing so, I plan to turn this 5pm to 9am passion into a fulltime profession. I believe Flatiron to be the best resource for enabling that transition.

**Tell us about your professional/educational career to date. What are you up to now and how did you end up there? ***

After graduating Boston University, I took an eclectic gig in brand marketing for an industry leading specialty coffee producer named Joseph Brodsky. Joseph’s company, Ninety Plus, had become a coffee sensation after several baristas won coffee world championships using Ninety Plus produce in 2013. Joseph and I were introduced, and he asked if I’d be interested in traveling with him for one year to create content that would support the brand online. I said yes.

Italian, Greek, Panamanian and Chinese immigration officers all stamped my passport within 30-days of my startdate. Throughout that year I averaged nearly one flight a week. From the high-end coffee and tea houses of Tokyo, Middle Eastern speciality coffee expos in Dubai and the company owned Gesha estates in Panama, that year gave me industry exposure to a depth that even the professionals who retire from coffee might never experience.

I was somewhat of an anomaly by the year’s end. Knowing everyone who was anyone in coffee as a friend, yet still unable to even turn on an espresso machine. My career going forward, as I saw it, was not in journalism or online marketing. However, I’d joined Ninety Plus for a very specific purpose. And to transition into a traditional industry role at their level would have converted me from an asset into a liability.

So I decided to leave. Looking for an opportunity where I could grow holistically through merit - albeit, rapidly from my experience and connections. That opportunity appeared in Brooklyn, thanks to a dear friend who had collected some stranger's business card while at a dinner party. The stranger, John Moore, recently founded the Brooklyn based coffee roasting company Nobletree Coffee and operated two farms down in Brazil.

During this interim I was living at home in Miami, FL. On a Friday morning in early March of 2015, my friend texted me a picture of John’s business card. That evening I called John cold, and by Sunday he offered me a position as their sales manager. I packed one bag, booked a flight, found an apartment and started within two weeks.

In a short time my sales role wasn’t going as hoped. A state of the art roasting facility scheduled to open within weeks of my start-date was pushed back, along with the anticipated opening of Nobletree’s first cafe in the New World Trade Center. Every business I approached resounded the same message of “come back to us when you’re open”, and I was barely able to pay rent with the majority of my income relying on commissions that weren’t coming in.

Four months later, I handed in my two weeks notice. To date, the cafe and roastery are still not open.

During my final month at Nobletree I once again had started networking, and through a friend was introduced to an employee at the SaaS start-up Percolate. I’m embarrassed to say that when he first mentioned Percolate I assumed I was back among coffee folks. However a minute’s research remedied the misconception, and this new friend got me an interview.

After four interview rounds, speaking with everyone from entry level employees all the way up to the CEO, an offer letter appeared in my Gmail inbox. To date I’m still with Percolate.

As mentioned in my answer to the previous question, while at Nobletree I concepted Five Dollar Feast. Being at Percolate has not only established structure in my career that’s helped me best utilize my free time for further education and entrepreneurialism, but has also given me access to a very strong tech community. From this I now have mentors that help guide my pursuit to becoming a skilled developer, as well as assist in clearing the hurdles of Five Dollar Feast from a technical standpoint.

When thinking critically about my future and goals, I don’t see furthering myself as a sales professional as an effective way to end up where I want to be. Having had many varied experiences to date, I have deep understanding for my age of what freedom and opportunity I’m striving for in my career. With great clarity, I see development as the best path to realize those goals. Committing myself to further education is the most effective way of getting there.

**Describe your background with computer programming. Please be as detailed as possible. Feel free to include links to any applications you've built, courses you've completed, etc...***

My first <!DOCTYPE html> was keyed into Code Academy’s code editor in the Spring of 2013. Everything I learned during that time was, to be honest, immediately forgotten. So computer programming, for me, really started in June of 2015.

Three resources over the past month have been most impactful in my coding skills:

1) Learn Code the Hard Way’s *Learn the Command Line*

2) MEAN Stack Development Guide, where I’ve learned basics in Node, Angular and Express

3) General Assembly’s 3-month Front End Web Development course

Over the past months I’ve run through a labyrinth of online learning resources. This ranges from tutorials on EnvoTuts+, Lynda and Youtube; courses in PHP, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Jquery and SQL on Codecademy; reading the documentation for API’s like Google Maps Javascript SDK, Twitter and the Jquery/Jquery Mobile’s library.

The project that’s driven my learning is Five Dollar Feast. Through that, I’ve utilized Parse as a database provider, and leveraged their platform for safe user authentication, account sign up and hosting all of my data. Using Phonegap I host a local server to test my mobile app during development on both Android and iOS devices to insure consistent functionality. In the app itself, I’ve created and styled all the pages using HTML5 and CSS3, while utilizing JavaScript and JQuery for functionality.

I utilize TouchSwipe for mobile swipe functionality, and have spent much time learning the advanced functionalities of the Google Maps Javascript SDK - making use of prototypes, constructor functions and self invoking anonymous functions in my JavaScript files as to organize my code in a neat and effective manner.

Other than that, I use GitBash as my command line tool, Sublime Text 3 as my code editor and GitHub to insure my branches and master files are properly saved.

**The ability to think in a structured way, both creatively and quantitatively, to solve complex problems is an important element of being a successful developer. Can you tell us anything that demonstrates your abilities in that realm? (anything from standardized test scores to experience playing a musical instrument counts)***

Prior to college, I was a sponsored extreme whitewater kayaker. A sport not too well known, but one that took me on adventures down many of the world's great rivers.

A river expedition is something that takes much more than a fearless attitude. Many of the rapids that my team pursued prohibited raft support, so supplies had to be rationed and stored within our kayak’s limited space. In that rationing we estimated for error - meaning that when a kayaker is ripped out of his boat by a rapid, all the supplies he had with him are taken like lunch money by the river. Allocating the most life sustaining supplies across the team, taking into account each boaters skill level, was a necessary practice.

On several of our expeditions, we paddled rivers and creeks that (to our knowledge) had never been paddled before. Unlike most sports, in kayaking there is often no walking off the court. Once you are in a 1000 ft gorge, you are in a 1000 ft. Helicopters - unlike in the movies - really only ever make it in time to pick up the body. So while pushing your individual limits was always the goal, the looming reality was that lives were always on the line - so this is how we worked.

Let’s say there are five kayakers. One is the lead. Whenever the group approaches a rapid, the lead paddles up as close as he can to a point of no return to scout the “best” route. In scouting he has a decision to make, safety versus skill. Taking into account the team’s perceived skill level as a whole, he makes a decision on how the group will run the rapid and goes for it - they all follow.

Being the lead is an incredible responsibility that demands enormous creativity. Why? Because when you are running a rapid that has a fallen tree blocking half the river, a large hazardous boulder below that and a waterfall at the end, the best route is almost **never** “go straight”!

Admittedly, that is the fun part. Reading the river and guiding your pod successfully through an exhilarating run. Sadly, it’s not always fun. Whitewater kayaking is one of the world’s most dangerous sports, with life threatening hazards always present in even the most beginner of rapids. When it goes wrong, here’s what can happen.

A boater following me falls off route and gets caught in the fallen tree. He’s stuck, and the force of the river is pushing his boat into the bramble beneath the tree with him inside it. I estimate that there is 30 to 45-seconds until he is underwater, and another 30 to 45 seconds until it’s too late.

After improvising a new path to navigating our pod to the riverbank, I jump out of my boat and grab a safety rope and rescue kit. I know I can pull with approximately 300lbs of force, however the river current is pushing the trapped boater with at least 1000lbs of pressure - plus his body weight. So quickly, I calculate how many pulleys must be set for an optimal mechanical pulling advantage on the rope. Three pulleys is the answer; each pulley doubling the strength of my pull force.

20 seconds in, where do I anchor the rope? Looking 360-degrees for any feasible options, there are (luckily) several trees up river. I run up to a tree that is roughly 45-degree to the river current - in respect to the trapped boater - and anchor the rope. This allows for the least fight against current, as well as best uses the current to help in dislodging the boat. By now, the rope is harnessed, I’ve locked in the third pulley, the rest of the pod is on the river bank with me and - luckily - the trapped kayaker is still above water.

45 seconds, the rope needs to get attached to the boat. The kayaker is screaming for help as his grip is slipping from the branches, giving me no time to walk cautiously out across the fallen tree to him. I need to jump in the river.

I run up the bank with another rope and lasso it around a nearby boulder while estimating the length needed to reach the trapped boater yet not get caught in the tree myself. I make a decision, and jump in the river.

1 minute, I’m swimming towards the tree and see the boat has flipped. He is under water. Meters away from the boat, I realize that I overestimated - there is too much slack in my rope. This gives me one chance for both of us. I need to land on the boat, slam the pulley rigged rope’s carabiner on a hitch, and hug tightly.

Moments before hitting the boat, I look at the team on shore - they are ready. So I float, and a second later hit the boat, slam on the carabiner and hug the bow - literally - like my life is depending on it.

After a dozen strong tugs by the rest of the team on shore we are in calm water on the river bank. The trapped boater is completely frazzled, but conscious. My heart beat can be heard over the crashing water. Through several physics calculations and the creative application of limited resources, I made split second decision that ended up saving two lives - the trapped kayaker, and my own.

Most importantly, 15-minutes later we were back in our boats and headed down stream.

**Is there anything else you'd like us to know?**

The first internship I ever had, which admittedly was somewhat out of character, was at the insurance company C.V. Starr. On one particular day while there I had the opportunity to eat lunch with our CEO Maurice Greenberg - the legendary CEO of AIG. During that lunch he gave me and the other attendees a very impacting piece of advice. He said, “I don’t know how to do everyone’s job well enough to do it for them. But I do know how to do their job well enough to tell if they are bullshitting me”.

In many ways, this quote has since solidified an internal rubric of how to evaluate my readiness for managing others and entrepreneurial endeavors. I’ve very purposefully taken opportunities that would give meaningful exposure into the different business disciplines. Having had meaningful exposure in sales, marketing, creative and some operations, product and IT are the two areas I’m now in a passionate pursuit of learning.

With that in mind, I hope that as a developer I will be accepted to continue this pursuit at the Flatiron School.

I am a weekend warrior when it comes to personal projects. While most of my career goals are entrepreneurial, I believe that taking an opportunity to learn from another company while I'm still young is the wisest decision. As I am now, while working for someone else, I will always further pursue education and projects that are meaningful.
