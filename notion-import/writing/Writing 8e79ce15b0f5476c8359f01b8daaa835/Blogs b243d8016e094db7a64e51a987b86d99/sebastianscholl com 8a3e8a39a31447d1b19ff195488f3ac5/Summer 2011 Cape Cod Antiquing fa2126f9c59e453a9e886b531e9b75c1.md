This morning I listed two new items on my Etsy shop, and I think they are awesome.  The first one is a 1930's Narragansett Beer Tray that I picked up at a yard sale in Chatham.  Paint is still intact, no dents and just an fun thing to have around...to bad I'm selling it!

The second is a weird one, but truly unique.  The Charles E. Hire Company was establish in 1886 and made Extracts up till the mid 20th century.  They were most famous for Hires Root Beer, but in the 1920's tried making Ginger Ale Extract (stuff to make Ginger Ale at home with...awesome), but the stuff didn't catch on and soon went out of production...that's really all the history I could find.  I happened to pick up a bottle of this stuff, still with the original packaging and instructions, uncorked, at an Estate sale.  It's a little piece of history; hopefully someone collects this kind of stuff...

So the hardest part of being in Chatham for me is that I haven't found many restaurants where I can get a good healthy meal...this has led me to resorting to good unhealthy meals unfortunately.  However by looking for something tasty, and not to low on the health charts, I've found my two favorite spots to eat in Chatham.  The Corner store, and Ollie's - food to go.

Right on Main street when heading towards Harwich from Chatham, anyone with eyes fit enough to drive won't be able to miss the sign.  This small joint has a variety of Burgers, Sandwiches, I think I saw salads... and other good stuff.  A small and clean spot with friendly staff.  I got a good recommendation on a Pulled Pork BBQ sandwich, and enjoyed my simple sandwich of BBQ pork with coleslaw on top.

It was a convenient and quick stop to grab a quick bite.  I'll be back.

I don't know what else to blog about now...maybe I'll do something cool later

Yesterday while driving down the road I passed a yard sale sign and practically tossed myself out the passenger side window in a stunt quality U-turn.  Pulling up and running in, most of the stuff had been purchased and the owner looked at me and said "We will practically take any offer"...music to my ears.  Running around like a chicken with its head cut off I poked through every nook and cranny in an attempt to scavenge what those before me may have missed.  A unique trash bin for $2.00, a bizarre "Rules of the Pool" table for $3.00 along with a few vintage leather suitcases, I was enjoying myself but not seeing anything eyeopening.  Coming around a corner and stopping in my tracks, I had found the item that I could not leave without.  An old chest with worn red paint and a beautifully designed lid that read "We Owe Allegiance to No Crown!"  The patriot in me was aroused and I new I wouldn't leave without it.

A price tag said $100, so I offered $50.  They took it without a second of hesitation...I could have gone lower.   The chest is in perfect condition, as if it was never used.  I'm excited to get it up online, along with my other items, and see what it's worth!  Below are some other pictures I took of the chest.
