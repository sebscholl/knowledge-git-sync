I'm finding myself at a familiar point. However, I do feel more calm of mind than the last time.

4 weeks, if not months, I felt a level of dissatisfaction with my romantic partner. In my own mind I began delaying and nitpicking many behaviors, some larger than others, that I found frustrating and annoying. And deeply affected my mood and overtime developed in me the confidence to act hold within the relationship.

I have a number of other things going on in my life that are sources of focus and stress. I'm not sure how these have impacted my attitude towards Lola who I love very much.

I can't help but to feel there is a pattern in my own behavior that leads me down this path which I seemingly have blinders on to a point of hurt and hardship. In this case, I'm effectively distancing myself from someone I love, hoping that it gives us the opportunity to re-engage in a more loving and affectionate way. Not a routine way, which living together essentially has enabled.

What is the checklist of things I should be aware of when approaching this mindset. Here are some ideas, specific to Lola.

Cons

She talks, so much. I often feel like her attention is always escaping her, allowing her to only ever learn or discuss subjects topically, and often miss root meaning other value.

She acts overly subservient at times when she should portray strength. While it can be fun in the bedroom, it often puts the burden on me to make any decision, everyone of which simply feels like I'm hurting her.

She sometimes lacks class in environments that I wish she could more appropriately, I'll be it through my eyes, behave.

She often falls through on commitments to social activities that she's promised to attend.

She's often overconfident to mask and in-security.

Pros

She is extremely supportive of the things I pursue.

She is extremely affectionate and caring, to the point of putting herself at a disadvantage to accommodate others.

She is fiercely independent, and sharing.

She takes a lot of pride in her work and accomplishments, which are formidable by nature.

She's open-minded sexually.

She has good intentions.

Notes

In my life I've learned to take a compliment, somewhat pitifully, but capably. That said, I've realized in this relationship that I've never learned how to accept help. It makes me deeply uncomfortable, and I fear that I'm always taking advantage of someone, which is very difficult for me.
