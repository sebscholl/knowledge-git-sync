**New Brief**

WASHINGTON - In light of gun control issues, terror attacks, and anything we’ve been effectively distracted from seeing, zealots from both political parties are patriotically standing their ground, blaming the other for recent events.  While accusations have been heated and inane, no one is yet sure which party will be held responsible for last week’s tragedies.  Liberals argue that if people didn’t have access to pressure cookers and Home Depots these events would have never happened.  Therefore, new legislation is being drafted that calls for background checks on kitchen supply and hardware store customers.  Conservatives, though, adamantly believe that any halfwit could have prevented the tragedies if everybody had Ar 15 rifles, grenades in their glove compartments, and a vigilante spirit.  Looking forward, legislators believe it may take one or two more tragedies for their proposals to be enacted, while conservatives pray that some average guy in Texas will use a firearm to heroically prevent a crime from occurring.
