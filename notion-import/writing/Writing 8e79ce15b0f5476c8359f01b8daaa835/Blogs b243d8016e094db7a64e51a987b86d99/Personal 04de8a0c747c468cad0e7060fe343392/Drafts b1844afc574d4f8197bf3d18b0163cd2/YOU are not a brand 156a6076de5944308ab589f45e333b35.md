# YOU are not a brand

Lifestyle marketing has completely blurred the lines between what’s private and public. So much so that the worlds’ treating people like products and products like people. I'm going to say that again. We're treating people like products and products like people.

Everyday, the world fawns over online

A brand indicates quality, not popularity

Losing self in the age of lifestyle

Most of the people doing lifestyle Marketing don't have a life

While young people are taking every measure to productize themselves, and then admire brands that are involved in "aid to Africa". How backwards is that?
