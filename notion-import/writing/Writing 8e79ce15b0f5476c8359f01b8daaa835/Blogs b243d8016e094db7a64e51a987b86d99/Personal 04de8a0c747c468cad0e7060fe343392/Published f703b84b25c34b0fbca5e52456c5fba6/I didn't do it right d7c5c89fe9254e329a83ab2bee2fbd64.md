# I didn't do it right

I didn’t give my undergraduate years the respect they deserved. Many of my days were spent reflecting, writing, and preaching all of my complaints with the institution I was apart of. How it’s value was false, there was nothing to learn, and that they had sold us on a value that was inherently backwards were just a few of my complaints. The friction between myself and my professors was most politely described as tense.

I do not disagree with much of what I thought. In fact some of the opinions I held then have only been strengthened since graduating. However, what is most definitely apparent now to me is that all of the frustrations I did have were fueled internally. All sprouting from the simple fact that I did not know why I was there.

My mind wasn’t in the moment. It was focused on ten to fifteen years down the road. My entrepreneurial and other career dreams had consumed me. And I couldn’t make a direct connection between how the work I was being told to do in the moment was going to help me develop to where I wanted to be. So I dissed it.

I was so consumed with where I wanted to be that I devalued the learning experiences that were necessary in getting there. And that learning experience was my undergraduate curriculum.

Instead I had decided that personal experience was the only way to enable true learning, but failed to acknowledge undergrad as an experience with its own lessons to learn. Additionally, my understanding of learning through experience fell short in not acknowledge that experience is as much to do with the people you surround yourself with as the environment you’re in. And that you must hone your own skills and character so that you bring your own value to a community and experience. Higher education is the only way in which you are able to do so.

My attitude towards graduate school is not of redemption. And I do not look at it as a second chance. I feel fortunate that I’ve come upon the true value and importance of attending through self-reflection and self-discovery. And done so with a deep understanding of the mistakes I made towards my academics during undergrad, which I am unquestionably motivated to not repeat.
