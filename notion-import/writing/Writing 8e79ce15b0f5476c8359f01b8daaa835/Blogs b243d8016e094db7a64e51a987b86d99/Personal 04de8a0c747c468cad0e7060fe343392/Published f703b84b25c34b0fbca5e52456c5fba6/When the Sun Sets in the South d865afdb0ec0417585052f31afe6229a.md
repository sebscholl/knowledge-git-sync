# When the Sun Sets in the South

When the Sun Sets in the South

I’m airborne. Six-miles above the northern ice cap staring out my window. There isn’t a single cloud. Six-miles high, and I could pick up a snowball. It looks within an arm’s reach. The only features are cracks. Hundred mile long splinters in the ice. It’s frightening looking down. I couldn’t imagine looking up.

Picture yourself at the beach. And now look down. Do you see the ridges and canyons in the sand? As well as the summits and valleys? The ice differs astonishingly little from my icy window. Except for that it is all white. Flawlessly white. And occupied by an emptiness that any of us are never likely to experience.

The sun is setting in the south. I’ve never seen this before. Soon it will set and not return till spring.

I’ll never likely make a use of understanding this. However for some reason I find it reassuring. In a world as inhabited as our own, there are tens 10,000,000’s of square miles that only ever experience a predictable schedule of shadows. And for a species as conquering as we are, there exists a wild that we have no control over.

I’ve watched the sun set before. I’ve seen it rise, and tracked its progress throughout the day on a few occasions. If you had asked a few hours ago how it moves, I would have told you “it rises in the east and sets in the west”. At that time in my life, such was fact. But as of now, it’s not.

Once I land I’ll be back. The laws I’ve grown to accept will again be in effect. And the facts I've been taught will be irrefutably valid. Everything will work as everything always has for me. However I will have to always remind myself. That somewhere out there, the sun is setting in the south.
