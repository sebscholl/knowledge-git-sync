I have something I want to say.

V1

Woman of mine

Where have we been?

We've both lost our minds

Fearing the end

As it started to crash

We got defensive

Said it's not my fault

Before looking within

V2

All that's been said

It's all tainted

The ways that we see

Each other's intent

I want to wash out my eyes

My ears and my head

Reset my mind

Find love again

Pre Chorus:

And to do that

I promise you

That I will try

Try always to

Chorus:

Know you mean best

Aim to judge less

Not assume I'm right

Let go of dumb fights

Never loose sight

That I want you by my side

Yeah I want you

I just hope that you still want me too

V3

You can't love someone

If you don't love yourself

Even if it's a crutch, you

Pulled me from hell

Yeah I am no prince

I looked in the mirror

And stood there a boy

In a man's exterior

V4

I appologize

For what we've been through

For letting my shit

All affect you

Yeah I've been a dick

Trying to prove

I don't know what

But something to you

Pre Chorus:

To not loose what's left

I promise you

That I will try

Try always to

Chorus:

Know you mean best

Aim to judge less

Not assume I'm right

Let go of dumb fights

Never loose sight

that I want you by my side

Yeah I want you...

I just hope that you still want me too

V5

If this is an end

Of my life with you

I want you know

The whole fucking truth

About that boy

The one in the mirror

Absent his disguise

He's lonely and fears

That he doesn't deserve

The love he's receives

From the ones he loves

The girls of his dreams

I'll never forget

What I've had with you

Wherever this goes

I'll always try to

Chorus:

And Know you mean best

Aim to judge less

Not assume I'm right

Let go of dumb fights

Never forget the sight

Of when you by my side....
