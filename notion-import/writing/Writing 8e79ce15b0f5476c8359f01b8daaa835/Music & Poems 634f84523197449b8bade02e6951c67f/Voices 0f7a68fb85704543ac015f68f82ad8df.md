Verse:

I wanna to be a new man
I wanna put a bullet though my head

And let everything spill out
All the thoughts I thought I cared about

Forget what I've learned
Forget what I've seen and what I've heard

Until the very last drop
Enjoy the silence while drifting off

Verse:

It's so hard to feel
It's so hard when nothing seems real

But noise in my brain
The noise that fights with me all day

I wanna to make it stop
I wanna find a way to turn it off

Nothing I've tried has worked
When I sober up the noise still hurts

Chorus:

The voices are always yelling at me

They've learned my doubts and insecurities

I haven't found a way to fight them back

So instead I try to just stay distract-ed

Verse:

I wanna strip myself down

And lay naked on the ground

In the middle of the street

Watch the lights quickly approach me

I don't care who sees

I don't care what anyone thinks of me

Chorus:

The voices are always yelling at me

They've learned my doubts and insecurities

I haven't found a way to fight them back

So instead I try to just stay distract-ed

Verse/Bridge:

One voice says to get help

Help dealing with how I think of myself

Chorus:

The voices are always yelling at me

They've learned my doubts and insecurities

I haven't found a way to fight them back

So instead I try to just stay distract-ed
