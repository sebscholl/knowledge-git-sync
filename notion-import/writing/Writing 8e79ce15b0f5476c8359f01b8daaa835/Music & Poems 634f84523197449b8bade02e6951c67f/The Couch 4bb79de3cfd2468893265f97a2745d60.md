Come back to 

Our house again

The place we made 

Our vows within

Back when we 

Had just first met

And barely knew

Each other yet

Loves not dumb

But we are blind

And ignore all

Its warning signs

Lone-li-ness is

Hard to bear

Our fear of it is

Why we're still here

You sit there

Crying on our couch

Frightened that we 

Can't work this out

Drink, scream, fuck

Fight, sleep, and

Tomorrow the same

It's groundhog day

Except we still age

Let this be

Our last charade

Just like it

Was yesterday

My love is spent

My heart worn out

It's time to accept

We won't work this out

How will this even-

Tually play out

Will we stay friends?

Which of us moves out?

You take half

Of the nothing we saved

Good thing that

You kept your maiden name

3-years together

Lost over words

Even in hindsight 

It's all just a blur

You sit there

Crying on our couch

Frightened that we 

Can't work this out

So let this be

Our last charade

Just like it

Was yesterday

My love is spent

My heart worn out

It's time to accept

We won't work this out
