[I will buy you a new life vibe]

V1:

Come on sit by me
As we sip our beers
I'm sure you've wondered
How I ended up in here

Had luck been different I think
You'd know my name
But my luck swindled
Fame and fortune away

V2:

Once upon a time
I played All-State
I was first pick, till
Grades got in the way

Around that time the coach
Caught me smoking pot
After it happened
My bright future was shot

Bridge:

Had luck been different I think
You'd know my name

But I am here now
Drinking away the pain

Chorus:

Stuck in my past
And not trying to escape 

Between sips I think back
Upon my glory days

Now come round listen
To all that I have to say

Drinking on my throne
I am the barstool king

Yeah drinking on my throne

I am the, bar stool king

V3:

Did you know way back
That I played in a band?
We'd rock the house
Untill cops came busting in

I think we had what
It takes to reach the charts
Till a groupie turned wife
Forced me to a job

V4:

Would you belive
I had a beautiful wife
Millions of dollars,
And a house on some island

I was respected by
All my family and friend
I got caught cheating
And then that was the end

Bridge:

Had luck been different I swear
You'd know my name

But I am here now
Drinking away my pain

Chorus:

Living in the past

Is where I've come to stay

Between drinks I think back
Upon my glory days

Now come round listen

To all that I have to say

Drinking on my throne
I am a barstool king
