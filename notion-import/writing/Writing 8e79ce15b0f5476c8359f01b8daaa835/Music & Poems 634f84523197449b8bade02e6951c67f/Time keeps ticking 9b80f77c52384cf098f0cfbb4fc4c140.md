# Time keeps ticking

Time keeps ticking way too slow

For me to realize I'm getting older

Than I ever thought I would

Till people start dying that I love

I sometimes think the universe

Has its own way of telling us

That things like pain were meant to be

Sometimes I wish it stop tell me so much

Lately it's been talking so much
