Verse

C C G F(1st)

You said you'd come

You'd come around

You never did

You let me down

It always seems

To come to this

You make a mess

And say it's something that I did

Do you not see

How you abuse

And take for granted

The people you're close to

So when you say

I love you

Understand why

I don't believe you

! Riff chorus

Verse 2

Late last night

I jump in my car

No place in mind

Except for some place far

Before I hit

The end of the block

I headed back

As I was already lost

Go on ahead

Act like you care

Then shy away

Whenever I need you there

I quickly learned

To know that you

Think promises should

Dependent on your mood
