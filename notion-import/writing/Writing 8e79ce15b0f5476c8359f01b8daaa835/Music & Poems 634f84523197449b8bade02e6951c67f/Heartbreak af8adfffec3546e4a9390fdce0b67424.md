! Only play to E strong and then pick open strings !

There she sits

Split on a fence

Unable to decide

On to forgive

Or to forget

Of the man she loves

Who lost his mind

It hurts to stay

It hurts to go

It hurts to know

They're both there bleeding

From the cuts they left each other

While tryingÂ to dissect what love means

No

Love story

Skips that part

Where there's a heart break

Our

Love story

Is at that part

We fear we can't take

So let's

Hold on

Hold on tight an wait

Though in our good times and our bad

You were the best I ever had

And could we go back to where we began

I would do it all again
