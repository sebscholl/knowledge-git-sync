V1:
I hear you're treating all our problems like their entertainment

It makes me think that you don't want to solve a thing at all

You're always gossiping with friends about our situations

I guess it's what you do cause you have nothing going on

V2:
Knowing the backwards way your brain processes information

I'm happy saying that in your eyes I rather be wrong

It's hard to make decisions with so little information

Maybe that's why most people never ever act at all

(Instrumental Bridge: 8 Measures)

V3:

You're always scavaging, for worthless bits of information.

Making up stories that guilt me to behave how you want.

Though you have fooled me with your tricks on some special occasions.

You've won some fights, but I can guarantee you'll loose our war.

Interlude:
I can guarantee you'll loose our war (2x)

V4:
The way you've acted has now become my justification

To go ahead and with out pause just fucking end it all

You think what we have is a precious thing that's worth maintaining

But what's the point when it's hard work to barely get along

Outro:
I can guarantee you'll loose our war (3x)

You've won some fights, but I can guarantee you'll loose our war
