Verse: A B D A (4x)

Chorus: F# F# D D, A B D/Db/B/A

V1:

A lady by day

A vixen by night

She smokes a black long

While all the guys fight

For her company

Give it to me please

No more girls, I want a woman

Not some innocent teen

V2:

I am not

Your average kid

Whose only fetish

Is whatever he gets

I'm a man with needs

And I want them seen

By a real woman

That has tricks up her sleeve

Chorus:

Tell me

Your needs

Teach me to make you scream

Exhaust all my fantasies 

V3:

From the girls

That I've been with

None, have been 

Naughty like this 

The days about to break

We've spent all night awake

Giving you all I can give

Now there's no more you can take

V4:

I grab my clothes 

Off the edge of the bed

To leave knowing that

I'll never see you again
