Verse 1:

I want you here, alone with me

I miss the feel, of you're heart beating

In every life, we meet someone

Who breaks our heart, and leaves us all fucked up

Verse 2:

All these nights, I've spent alone

Wishing I, could come back home

Despite our fights, my hearts not changed 

I wish I knew, whether you feel the same

Low Chorus:

And now I feel, so lost without you

Scared there's, nothing I can do

To find, my road back to you

I just feel, so lost without you

(Instrumental Section)

(Chorus)

Verse 3:

This time apart, has made me see

Just how much, you mean to me

I guess that's how, love must works

We forget to care, until it hurts

(Chorus)

And now I feel, so lost without you

Scared that there is nothing I can do

You locked me out, I'm trying to break through

While I feel so lost without you

(Outro Instrumental)

I want you here, alone with me

These nights alone, have made me see

How blind I've been, to how you love
