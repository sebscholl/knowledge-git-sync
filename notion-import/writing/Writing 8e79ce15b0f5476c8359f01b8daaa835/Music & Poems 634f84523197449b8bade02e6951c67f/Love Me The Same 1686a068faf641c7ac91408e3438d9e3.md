Capo 3

V1: C, Bm69, Am7, Fsus2

Darling grab a coat, as here comes the rain
Down from dark clouds, hiding the sun's rays

That we once felt, in our early days
While it seems now, they've gone away

I've kept you warm, I've kept you safe
From demons you, can not escape

So I as see, you drifting away
It breaks me down, to think I gave my heart in-vain

V2:

So many times, we've laid in bed
I stare at you, staring ahead

When we're together, you feel so far
Get out of your head, the distance is hard

I've seen your heart, I've seen your face
At times when you've, sent the guard away

And while they have been, few and far
They're why I'm still here, trying so hard

Chorus:

Am7, G, E, Am
It hurts so much
It's driving me insane
This feeling that
You don't feel the same

F                                   G
And I don't think that I have the strength
E                   Am
To last another day

F
So if this is real
G
Please make me feel
G-12-Harmonic
Like you love me the same

V2:

You barely talk, one word replies
I ask what's wrong, I'm told it's fine

It seems you think that, you're able to hide
By not looking at, me in the eyes

I tell my self, this ain't worth the fight
I could end it now, set my life right

Though while I am, strong of mind
With you I am still, weak inside

Interlude:

E,                 F,                     C/G
Everyday I wake up and pray

E.                          F.                         C/G
Pray that today something will change

```
  E.                 F.                      Am.                  G

```

It's become a routine that, I can't seem to break

```
 E.                 F.              C/G

```

If Cupid only shot both ways

Chorus:

Am7, G, E, Am
It hurts so much
It's driving me insane
This feeling that
You don't feel the same

F                                   G
And I don't think that I have the strength
E                   Am
To last another day

F
So if this is real
G
Please make me feel
E
Yeah if this is real
Am
Please make me feel
F
So if this is real
G
Please make me feel
G-12-Harmonic
Like you love me the same

Outro:
Like you love me the same
Like you love me the same
Like you love me the same
