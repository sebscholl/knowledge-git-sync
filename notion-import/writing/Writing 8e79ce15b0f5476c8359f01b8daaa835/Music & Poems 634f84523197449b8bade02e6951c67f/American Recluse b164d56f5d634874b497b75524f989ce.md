(Catch hell blues, jack white)

There is a dangerous rise in anti-vaxxers
I saw a headline about it on a magazine cover
The rest of the facts I'm sure I can guess
As my opinions I feel are better than facts

The worlds suffering from such mis-information
That's what I'm seeing, unless I've missed information
Everyone's heads are up each other's asses
Getting high on their own and like minded gasses

The safest thing that there seems to do
Is protect myself and become a recluse

It's not obvious what it's happening
Unless you are, of course, as intelligent as me
As I'm open minded to new points of view
If I already agree with the messenger's too

I heard the president has a secret plan
To make us all take a prescription
That will make the whole population sick
And all big pharma companies rich

The safest thing that there seems to do
Is protect myself and become a recluse

Black sheep caught in a herd of lies

Philanthropy? What a clever disguise
How could it be genuine, if I don't do it myself
