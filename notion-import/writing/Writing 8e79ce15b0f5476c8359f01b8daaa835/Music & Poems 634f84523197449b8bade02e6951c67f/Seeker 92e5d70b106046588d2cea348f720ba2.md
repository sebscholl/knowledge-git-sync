Tuning: Half-step down with Drop D

Triplets with hammer-ons and pull-offs. 

Verse 1:

It seems to be

A time again

To venture out

From where I've been

Leave the place

I've come to know

Forget the safety

Of my home

Verse 2:

I've set out

On my own

In search for something

I don't yet know

I've been living

A comfortable life

Yet in it I'm

Dissatisfied

Chorus:

Wake up

Your mind

Search and

You'll find

Seeker

It's time

Go on

It's fine

Verse 3:

There'll be times

You feel regret

And wish you had

Never left

Remember life's not

Where you go

But the journey

Along the road

Chorus:

Wake up

Your mind

Search and

You'll find

Seeker

It's time

Go on

It's fine

Outro:

Seeker, it's fine

Seeker, don't hide

Seeker, it's time

Go on, live life
