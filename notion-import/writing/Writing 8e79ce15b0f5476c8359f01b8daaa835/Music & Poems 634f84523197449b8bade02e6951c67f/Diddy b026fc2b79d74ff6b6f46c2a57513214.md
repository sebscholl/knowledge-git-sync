Verse: Base rift on D with Octive

Bridge: D D D Cb/A

Chorus: E...

All dressed up trying to look your best self
Did it all trying to escape the hell
In which you've trapped yourself
With story that your mirror tells

Doesn’t matter what it is you wear
Don’t matter what brand your clothes bear
You’re cursed to forever be aware
Of those to whom you compare

You think you're absolutely nothing

You think you're absolutely nothing

You think you're absolutely nothing

You think you're absolutely nothing

Still go out and buy your nice things
And think they might disguise your being
But no matter what shit you go buy
You’ll always be you in your eyes

You think you're absolutely nothing
You think you're absolutely nothing

You think you're absolutely nothing

You think you're absolutely nothing

[Break, speaking, drums on symbols]

You know this isn't gonna end well

All alone still hating yourself

There’s no red or blue pill

No quick way to enlightenment

You think you're absolutely nothing

You think you're absolutely nothing

You think you're absolutely nothing

You think you're absolutely nothing
