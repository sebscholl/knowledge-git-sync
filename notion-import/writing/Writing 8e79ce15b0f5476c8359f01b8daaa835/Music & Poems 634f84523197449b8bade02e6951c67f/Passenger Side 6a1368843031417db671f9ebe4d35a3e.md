V1:

I was driving back home last Sunday

When I saw out the passenger side

A tall handsome man, hand in hand

With the girl who used to be my wife

V2:

Yeah maybe I'm a little bit bitter

And in time I will not hate the sight

Before separating, I could not foresee

The pain she would still leave behind

Chorus: Played on A and D string

9/12 x 4, 9/11, 5/7

5/7 x 3, 7/9, 5/7

0/0 x 5, 2/2, 5/5

All I ever needed, was space from you

To let my anger subside

While sometimes I miss you, I'm still unable

To forgive, all the ways, you lied

V3:

Now I am back out searching for someone

Pretending like I've moved on fine

Even misery, needs somebody

To keep it warm at night

V4:

Yet no one seems to matter who lays here

Nothing seems to matter at all

All I can see, is how you seem

To move on, like it's nothing at all

Musical Interlude.

Chorus.

Outro.
