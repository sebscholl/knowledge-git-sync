# Wanted - the Novel

I am him, he is me.

A young millennial’s eccentric identical twin brother disappears after being convicted for a high level white collar crime. With his brothers face posted all over the media next to the words “wanted”, the innocent brother is confused for his other half by the world. At first in shock, he makes it clear that it is his twin who was responsible for crimes. However, soon realizes that he can begin acting as he wish with a get-out-of jail-free card by blaming all mischievousness on his brother. In the final chapters of the book, it becomes clear to the narrator that his “identical twin” was a fabricated identity he had imagined of himself, and he is forced to come to grips with the reality of his position.

“A modernized fight club, showing a young mans’ battle between living an ideological vs. materialistic life”

Chapter 1:

He's always been a little bit better than me. Not that I lack much. But from my perspective, for as long as I can remember, he's had the edge.

Aside from behavior, we are the same. I am him. He is me. To avoid any confusion, I’ll skip the metaphysical description. We are twins. Identical, too. Down to the freckles, almost. If it weren’t for a few scars on his knuckles that he proudly owned as souvenirs from his adventures, even I would confuse him for a mirror. Fundamentally though we're different. Very different.

I've never really liked him. That may seem like a harsh thing to say about one’s brother - and twin, at that. But I’m certain that he says the same about me. Regardless of our opinion of the other, we've always been inseparable. At least up until recently. There was always a curiosity that oozed from both of us in regards to the other. A craving the study the other’s thoughts and actions. Rarely was it out of fondness. Tormenting each other to the brink of madness was considered an achievement by either of us. My guess now, which is many years later, is that we felt that the other had taken something that should have been ours at birth. And if they hadn’t, we would have been more complete.

It may be best for me to describe myself. Then you’ll better understand him, which is who I’m already assuming you’re more interested in learning about.

I am, and always have been, more satisfied with my thoughts than actions. You may think that means I prefer to think than act. It’s not the case. Instead I mean that I do act, surprisingly often given the amount of stress it causes me. However, the thoughts that inspire my actions have always been more fulfilling than the actions themselves. Making me wonder if things can never turn out as good as you think they can, or if I just expect too much from the world.

It’s a silly story, but one I’ve always felt explains me pretty well. When I was eleven-years old I was in a situation that could have been my first kiss. At that age no one is very observant, and neither was I. I couldn’t tell you now, and probably even then, what her hair color was, if I found her attractive, or how she smelt. All I knew was that she was *girl*, I was *boy*, and kissing was a something that could happen. We were sitting in the back seat of a rusty old taxi-cab parked along my parents’ house. The game was hide and seek, and we had hid together.

I knew I wanted something to happen, but I wasn’t sure what. Feeling uncomfortable with myself, as any 11-year old would in such a situation I imagine, I began acting as I assumed my brother would. Asking pointless and off topic questions like whether or not she liked classical music and if she had ever gone on vacation. He happened to show up as soon as my act began, and laughed at me without restraint – knowing well that I wouldn’t be able to being him off well enough for what I was trying to do. I became perplexed by self-consciousness, which invariably had similar effect on the girl. In a state of panic I did what was completely unexpected of me. Before flinging myself out the door, as if with the intention of barreling straight through my brother, I politely said “I love classical music” and as fate had it moved my first erotic experience several years back.

It’s not that he is, or was, more attractive than me. Truly, we are identical. For some reason though he has always been better with girls. Don’t get me wrong, I can hold my own. Girls have always liked me. At least some have. My relationships have always been more meaningful than his. Then again, he has never really had any. And I understand why. It is frankly one of the few things we are comfortable acknowledging about the other. My ability to commit to someone has always been as strong as his ability to move on from someone. Ironically, I’d be willing to bet that he is as happy as I am with what our “abilities” have gotten us in terms of happiness or fulfillment – and that is nothing at all.

I hope that I’m not making myself out to be some seemingly depressed and awkward introvert. It is really not the case. Despite our differences and opinions of each other, we have always been, as I mentioned earlier, inseparable. Everywhere I went he came, and everywhere he went I did the same. Luckily, we both developed a good sense of when to keep our mouths shut and let the other do the talking early on. And because of it, our ability to fit in with the each other, whether for the purpose of pursuit or entertainment, has resulted in the best stories that I will likely never tell my children.

Chapter 2:

As indispensable as we have always been, until the age of 14 I was never convinced that I actually need him in my life. He was always there, but lived our separate lives, acting our different ways.

It was naturally about a girl. Men aren’t that complicated. Anything can usually be boiled down to a sexual urge or materialistic desire for what motivates us. Everything above that is what I’d say we can call *layers.* The girl was Marissa. That was her name, I mean. And for months I had been pursuing her.

Call it a *pursuit* might sound admirable. But I promise that it was for the soul reason that she was a known slut, and I desperately wanted to loose my virginity. To sleep with Marissa was not a romantic endeavor, but more of a business transaction. Two of my friends had already punched in their V-card with her. And the stories of them doing so, meaning what happened in the act, emotionally differ very little from one of my Mother going to the grocery store or myself having lunch.

My guess about why I was unsuccessful for so long was that I discreetly wanted to believe that there was something more to it. And by being a person who needs a severe handicap when it comes to any type of subtlety, my intentions were obvious and a turn off.

I almost *sealed the deal* on my own with her, once. It was just after I had originally met her. We were lounging on the sofas of the used smelling common area at my school. Some other friends of mine were there as well, as we all were - in body, not mind. The conversation was inconsequential. To the point where it was distracting enough for the group to be engaged, but myself withdrawn and not feeling as though I was left out of something. Marissa, sitting not to far me, turned her dreadlocked head my way for the sake of an itch or some other unapparent reason. And in that moment, in a manner similar to one I’d used to ask the time, I said to her “we should have sex”.

“Ok”. That’s all I got. It was a definite yes. I know, because I had heard her say it to others before. It was late in the evening, and our schools social hours were nearing an end. So knew that we wouldn’t be able to act now. Which was unfortunate, because if such was possible, I may have been able to accomplish the process on my own.

The next day I behaved attentively. As if I wanted something from her more than what she had agreed to. I wasn’t looking for love, but understanding. A 14-year old boy is made up of the weakest insecurities. His only hope is to believe that he had accomplished something, in anything he does. I wanted to know that I had won her. Again, not her heart necessarily. Instead, I begged to know whether I had conquered a foe worth conquering.

I hadn’t. Obviously now looking back. Instead I had shared with her a piece of myself. And she didn’t like it. I remember clearly asking her if we could do it in my dorm after class. This is a month or so after her having been avoiding me from when it all started. Her answer was a flat no, followed by the reason that I had freaked her out.

Freaked her out? No I hadn’t. I had exposed myself, which I then learned achieved the same result with most people. So I withdrew, kept to myself, and only myself. I avoided her completely. However, as soon as I did withdraw, my brother jumped in. And as I always had done, I watched him.

He was cold and cool, charming and brash. “How in the hell could we have turned out so differently? Despite us being the same?” I’d often ask myself. When I say jumped in, I mean that he took my place pursuing Marissa. He was still a virgin to. I’m not sure why. For as together as he was, he was still growing into himself as I was. But I knew that in this game, he had the upper hand, and from him I had much to learn.

I took him one conversation - after the weeks of fixing my reputation with her, that is. Around her he didn’t think before he acted. He’d just act, and be completely unapologetic or regretful of any outcome that proceeded. If I’m right, he was able to restore “our” reputation, so to speak, by making her believe that whether she was present or not, or cared or not, he would behave in no different a manner. In short, her presence meant nothing to him.

The day it happened I was watching, as always. It was the same lounge as I had been in. And was mostly the same crowd with the exception of one or two. He was engaged, not with her, but the group. At times she’d try to jump in, and when she did her comments would be wicked of from the conversation like dew drops in a wind. He’d do so not for the sake of being rude, but to establish that he was impenetrable, irreplaceable. And after a short amount of time, her turned to her and plainly said “we should have sex”.

“Let’s go”. She said it and they were off. I can’t remember if the hour had been different from when I asked her. And whether or not such was so is irrelevant. He was leading. His words were not a shy suggestion, but an irrefutable statement. As they walked off I followed.

He knew I was following but didn’t care. He never cared. It was a large part of what made him himself. I stayed a bit back though so that she wasn’t aware. In many ways this was a big moment for both of us. And I didn’t want to ruin it from being myself. We were roommates.

I waited till the door sounded shut before turning the corner into our hall. There were no large keyholes to look through, or mirror to slide under the door. All there was to do was sit out with my back the door and pretend it was me in there.

I could hear them talking. Or him talking more so. He had questions about what to do, which he did ask shamelessly. You can only learn so much from watching porn. And while we both had watched our fair share, I knew he was standing in there dick in hand without the slightest clue of how to live up to the glamorized movies. With her help though, they figured it out. And I soon heard her moaning. Moaning not out of pleasure, but in a way that suggested she too was a bit confused with what was happening. And believed that moaning was her part to play in the act.

Telepathy is a difficult word to use. However, it is the best descriptor I know of to describe the connection between us. A few minutes or so after they had started, I felt that he wanted me in the room. So slowly I turned the nob. And as the door creaked open, with her face towards the wall he beckoned me over.

His eyes were lifeless. Not a glint of excitement or enthusiasm. In that moment he seemed as though he was inside her for the sake of a job, not desire. And that the experience had neither a positive or negative effect on him, but instead left him in a state of nothingness.

As I moved towards him, I could tell he wanted out. He had accomplished that which he had wanted to, and wanted me to finish the rest. To my surprise, I did. Stripping down naked, I moved up next to him. She didn’t notice as he slid out and I slid in. Nor did she realize it a minute or two later when I had finished and he had quietly left. At this point in our lives no one could tell us apart. He had not received the scars on his knuckles yet.
