Few things sooth the soul like a good story. One that reassures preconceived notions and is predictable. Like a good family dog. In the very beginning, it peaks your interest by an alluring character or the hint of an meaty plot. And as it develops everything ties into a seemingly unavoidable point of climax. Where a protagonist and antagonist clash and resolve. Thatâ€™s it, adorably wrapped up and perfectly displayed. A pill prescribed to everyone.

If you read the first and last chapter of any book, everything in between becomes too easily deducible. All stories have this same problem. Which makes them fundamentally

different from life, which is not a story, but instead an empty container that we can only fill with stories. It helps with the emptiness.
