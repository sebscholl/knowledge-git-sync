Believing in trust

Most of you have probably heard of CouchSurfing, though very few of you have likely tried it. Sleeping on a someone’s couch that you met on the internet goes against most any conventional wisdom. And for a very simple and seemingly valid reason - how can you trust a stranger?

Would you trust a stranger? With your money, health, or safety? Most people would say no. However, that is all we do in life – take risks and trust strangers. Strangers run your bank, and you trust them to protect your money. Strangers make your medications, and you take them trustingly. And strangers ensure your safety, and you expect them to respond to a three-digit phone call. Strangers are the people responsible for maintaining the life you live.

The question, “would you trust a stranger?” has an absolute answer - yes. Maybe consciously you find the idea uncomfortable, but subconsciously you accept it. Here is the kicker though. When you stay at a hotel you are paying for the hospitality of strangers - and most people trust that relationship without question. But what if a stranger offered you his hospitality…or couch...for free. Would you be willing to trust them?

After an unsuccessful brainstorming session on how to spend my six-day break - that had began that afternoon - I decided to let the airlines decide for me. I went onto [www.Skyscanner.net](http://www.skyscanner.net/) and entered “Departing from: London”, “Destination: Everywhere”. A long list of flights began to load in the order of least to most expensive. And after the search had completed, at the very top was a $32 flight to Gothenburg.

It was 12:30am and I had just booked a ticket to Gothenburg, Sweden – departing in six-hours. I’d never been to Gothenburg, nor did I have a clue where I was going to stay. The only thing I did know was that in less than ten-hours I would be there, and needed to figure out a place to stay.

I soon learned there were only two hostels in the city that were priced far beyond my budget, and the hotels were thrice those costs. After visiting all of my last minute deal websites, I accepted the fact that it was time to think outside the box.

[CouchSurfing.com](http://couchsurfing.com/) is an international community of 6-million members that makes travel richer. It connects people, enabling travelers to find hosts in **every country on earth**. Whether you are traveling and need a place to stay, home and have a free couch, or simply looking for someone new to hang out with, CouchSurfing is the best - a network of people willing to share in profound and meaningful ways, making travel a truly social experience.

So I logged onto [www.CouchSurfing.com](http://www.couchsurfing.com/), searched Gothenburg, and posted the follow message:

*“Hey! I just spontaneously booked a ticket to Gothenburg and need a place to stay tomorrow night. Please message me if you can help! Thanks – Sebastian”*

By 3:30am a man named Alex had replied saying that he’d happily host me and to message him once I landed. It was that easy. Yes, that easy. For the next two days I didn’t only have a couch to sleep on, but a friend to hang out with. He showed me the city, trusted me in his home. And he did it for one reason:

*“I [Alex] like to help people travel”*

If you accept the idea that almost anything you do is fundamentally a relationship of trust with strangers, you may be comfortable with the idea of sleeping on a stranger's couch. I am. And that is why I Couch Surf.

You have to trust your own judgment. As well as be brave enough to push your comfort zone. Of course there are dangerous people out there, but what is the **true** likelihood that they are the ones opening their doors to strangers? Remember, you are as much a stranger to others as others are strangers to you. And if you understand, and are willing to accept, that the risk is mutual, you can join a community that offers over 6,000,000 free accommodations in 100,000 cities worldwide.

Individualism.
