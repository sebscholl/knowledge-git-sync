# Sebastian's Knowledge Base
I adopted this tool to future-proof my own note-taking and knowledge. The open-source editor that outputs Markdown files locally is - it seems - the best selection of digital tools for avoiding vendor lock-in and owning one's own data.

In this knowledge base, I'll be storing and organizing the learnings, music, ideas, and other information that I long collected across disparate journals and systems. I aim to become a fluent power-user of one system that will last me indefinitely.

### Principles of Knowledge
• ***Knowledge*** is not copied; it is authored.

### Bases
*Bases* are domains of focus (*creative*, *education*, etc.) While a subject may span multiple bases, such connections get made within the knowledge articles themselves. For example, an educational course I keep notes on may link to a document where that knowledge is applied professionally.

### Notes vs. Knowledge
Not everything is *knowledge*. Somewhat frequently do we collect scattered bits of information worth saving that do not yet, and may never, fit into our larger thought space. These can be anything from whimsical ideas, small reminders, and really...anything.

In this archive, the distinction between *knowledge* and *notes* remains distinctly separate. While *knowledge* may be slotted into discrete conceptual categories represented by hierarchical directory structures, *notes* are a flat list that leverage *tags* as their primary categorization tool.

Intermittently, *notes* are reviewed and, when relevant, transferred into the relevant *knowledge* struct they best identify with - if needed. Otherwise, *notes* allow a less burdensome way to chronicle notes and knowledge casually.

## Zettelkasten
[[zettelkasten]] [[workflows]]

Let us begin with the most important traits of a Zettelkasten:

1.  It’s hyper-textual.

We call an individual note a _Zettel_. Each Zettel needs a unique address by which we can refer to it, to make connections between Zettels. Then there can be hypertext and the note-taking system can qualify as a Zettelkasten.

2.  It adheres to the _Principle of Atomicity_.

That means that each Zettel only contains one unit of knowledge and one only. These units are the atoms to which the principle of atomicity refers.

3.  It is personal.

Emphasize connection, not a collection. The most important aspect of the body of the Zettel is that you write it in your own words. There is nothing wrong with capturing a verbatim quote on top. But one of the core rules to make the Zettelkasten work for you is to use your own words, instead of just copying and pasting something you believe is useful or insightful

## Athanaeum 

Where everything document I produce (article, blog, song, or other) gets chronicalized.

## Readings

Where everything I obtain through reading (information, not knowledge) can be chronicalized.
