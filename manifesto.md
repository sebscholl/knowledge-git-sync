# Sebastian's Knowledge Base

[2022-08-20]
I adopted this tool to future proof my own note taking and knowledge. The open-source editor that outputs Markdown files locally is - it seems - the best selection of digital tools for avoiding vendor lock-in and owning ones own data.

In this knowledge base, I'll be storing and organize the learnings, music, ideas, and other information that I long collected across disparate journals and systems. My goal is to become a fluent power-user of one system that will last me into the indefinate future.

### Bases
*Bases* are domains of focus (*creative*, *education*, etc.) While a subject may span multiple bases, such connections get made within the knowledge articles themselves. For example, an educational course I keep notes on may link to a document where that knowledge is applied in a professional capacity.

### My Bases
