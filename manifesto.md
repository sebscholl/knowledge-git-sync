# Sebastian's Knowledge Base
I adopted this tool to future-proof my own note-taking and knowledge. The open-source editor that outputs Markdown files locally is - it seems - the best selection of digital tools for avoiding vendor lock-in and owning one's own data.

In this knowledge base, I'll be storing and organizing the learnings, music, ideas, and other information that I long collected across disparate journals and systems. I aim to become a fluent power-user of one system that will last me indefinitely.

### Principles of Knowledge
â€¢ ***Notes*** can be copied; ***knowledge*** must be authored.

### Bases
*Bases* are domains of focus (*creative*, *education*, etc.) While a subject may span multiple bases, such connections get made within the knowledge articles themselves. For example, an educational course I keep notes on may link to a document where that knowledge is applied professionally.

### Notes vs. Knowledge
Not everything is *knowledge*. Somewhat frequently do we collect scattered bits of information worth saving that do not yet, and may never, fit into our larger thought space. These can be anything from whimsical ideas, small reminders, and really...anything.

In this archive, the distinction between *knowledge* and *notes* remains distinctly separate. While *knowledge* may be slotted into discrete conceptual categories represented by hierarchical directory structures, *notes* are a flat list that leverage *tags* as their primary categorization tool.

Intermittently, *notes* are reviewed and, when relevant, transferred into the relevant *knowledge* struct they best identify with - if needed. Otherwise, *notes* allow a less burdensome way to chronicle notes and knowledge casually.
