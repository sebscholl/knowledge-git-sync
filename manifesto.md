# Sebastian's Knowledge Base

[2022-08-20]
I adopted this tool to future proof my own note taking and knowledge. The open-source editor that outputs Markdown files locally is - it seems - the best selection of digital tools for avoiding vendor lock-in and owning ones own data.

In this knowledge base, I'll be storing and organize the learnings, music, ideas, and other information that I long collected across disparate journals and systems. My goal is to become a fluent power-user of one system that will last me into the indefinate future.

### Bases
*Bases* are domains of focus (*creative*, *education*, etc.) While a subject may span multiple bases, such connections get made within the knowledge articles themselves. For example, an educational course I keep notes on may link to a document where that knowledge is applied in a professional capacity.

### Notes vs. Knowledge
Not everything is *knowledge*. Somewhat frequently do we collect scattered bits of information worth saving that do not yet, and may never, fit into our larger thought space. These can be anything from whimsicle ideas, small reminders, and really...anything.

In order to model that in this archive, the distintion of *knowledge* and *notes* remain distinctly separate. While *knowledge* maybe slotted into discrete conceptual categories that are represented by hierarctical directory structures, *notes* are a flat list that leverage *tags* as their primary categorization tool.

Intermittently, *notes* are reviewed and when relevant transferred into the relevant *knowledge* struct that they best identify with - if needed. Otherwise, *notes* allow for a less burdensome way to chronicalize notes and knowledge on a casual basis.
