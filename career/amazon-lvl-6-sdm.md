## SDM Role
Software Development Managers own the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of the company’s software applications, systems, and technology projects. Software Development Manager combines a system designer, people manager, roadmap/customer satisfaction driver, and project manager.

## Why Amazon?
Well, 3 main reasons:
- I look at my own life, personal and professional, and see the depth to which Amazon positively elevates it (AWS for professional, Amazon for craft/shopping/hobby, Whole Foods for eating, Kindle/Audible for education). And in no way am I alone. The level of positive impact Amazon has on my life, and those around me, I find remarkable. And it’s an organization I’d love to dedicate my passion, brain-power, and drive to.
- I look at life as continuous education and learning. Every day, I want to get better, smarter, and stronger. So much of that is putting yourself in environments that are challenging, dynamic, and filled with other smart people. I’ve met many people who tell me Amazon is a competitive environment; while they might have said that from a negative, I look at it as a positive. Especially when considering that Amazon hires the best, which from this interview process alone, I believe to be true. That’s the type of environment I want to work, grow, and thrive in.
- Frankly, I’m really by, and also just the right amount nervous, by the scale of projects that I’d be able to contribute to and lead at Amazon. I’m extremely proud of the work I and the teams I’ve led have done at the startups I’ve work for. That said, the beneficiaries of that work has always been on smaller audiences. I’m super eager to take the technical and management skills I’ve developed to the next level, and can’t imagine a more formidable company to do so with than Amazon.

## Loop Interviews
My final stage of interviewing at Amazon culminates in the Loop interview. My recruiter, Jack Pandolfo, communicated that the following people will be interviewing me to validate the listed leadership principles.

	1. Tell story about developing Agency strategy for 8base and how CEO didn't see business model working.

#### Story 1 - Disagreed and things went your way.

CEO organized a company offsite for the core leadership team

Recently hired new project management director. 

Offsite described as being for refining direction and strategy. 

We'd been working on delivering a new front-end development product that would compliment our core backend-as-a-service offering. 

We got presented a new vision for the product we'd been working on. 
	
It was crafted by our CEO with input from the new project management director.

The we'd been developing was a UI developed web front-end framework for professional developers
- This new product vision was for a full-stack solution that enables citizen developer (non-technical or business people) to create apps. 
- I pressed the team members that were advocating for this new direction
- It became clear the new product direction was: 
	- Deeply rooted in what the new PM had delivered in past roles at low-code startups
	- Our CEO being excited by the idea of becoming a user of the product himself.
	- Advocated to open us up to a significantly larger community of potential users.
- I'm very open to new ideas 
	- At times completely shifted directions when presented with better data - regardless of how vested I was in an original strategy.
- I felt strongly that this wouldn't be good for the company for two reasons:
	- It didn't consider our existing customers, who had contributed to the design of and were anticipating the release of the product.
	- As a young start up, would splitting already sparse resources to attract an entirely new audience segment was a substantial risk.
- I asked for a week before anything got communicated to other teams.
	- Justified time to survey our existing user base in validating this new idea.
	- I was the closest person to the customers, and saw that this product lacked the flexibility and concepts expected by professional developers. 
	- I needed to get leadership to hear that from the people they assumed would adopt it.
- I quickly organized 10 different 20-minute calls with existing customers 
	- They completed a pro's and con's exercise in-relation to the competing product visions 
	- They responded to the prompt, "How might you leverage this in your professional development work?"
- I made call recordings available to all the stakeholders at my company
- I consolodated the data collected in a short summary and published it. 
- Only 1 customer viewed the new product vision as something they could leverage
- 9 articulated it being counter to the value propositions that originally attracted them to our solutions
- This exercise was sufficient in bringing everyone back to our core focus in serving professional software developers


#### Story 2 - Disagreed and things did not go your way.

- Current employer participating in acellerator program
- Our core product was a backend-as-a-service product being used by roughly 200 developers
- The product wasn't perfect, but delivered great value.
- Our CEO was frustrated that we weren't growing fast enough (developer adoption and subscriptions).
- I was the person closest to both product and our customers
	- My analysis was that we had a strongly foundation though lacked refinement seen in alternative solutions.
	- We had a lot of work to do to deliver on the potential we had, though the path to acomplishing that was product improvement.
- However, instead of focusing on improving our existing solution, our CEO and several other key team members felt that the best strategy for growth would adding a new product.
	- Their idea/vision was to introduce a front-end development solution that would work with our existing backend. 
- It was an interesting idea, but I felt strongly that it was distracting from our core competancies and focus, being backend, which still had a ton of maturing to do.
- Additionally, from many interactions I'd had with customers, none had expressed any interest in procuring front-end technologies from us. Instead, most had set opinions on their favorite front-end technologies, and came to us specifically for backend and that only.
- I took the time to write up an opinion on this direction, explaining how it was premature to make the decision that our best opportunity for growth was from introducing new products as opposed to strengthening our existing one.
	- I took the initiative of preparing a roadmap of new features that our customers had articulated wanting to see in the product
	- I also added other ones that I felt would be valuable, being a developer myself
- However, the others were adamant on expanding to the frontend, providing that it would also help significantly in sales and marketing efforts with business people who tended to be more visual
	- A challenge we faced often when demoing and selling the backend solution
- Unconvinced, I took a step back to speak with several of our larger customers that were digital agencies building software professionally.
- To my suprise, several of them said that they'd been looking for new front-end technologies that had the potential to reduce delivery time on client projects.
	- They'd explored some of the existing drag-and-drop tools screen builders, but found them too limiting for building custom applications (as opposed to marketing sites).
- I found this information encouraging.
- Were it up to me, I to this day would have stayed focused on backend.
- However, the team decided this is where they want to go, which made me think of only one thing, "I'm the one who needs to own this."
- Thus, I went back to the team and explained made a case for myself being the architect of the system, should we pursue this product.
	- I was the most senior technical person who deeply understood our customer's needs, which were ease of use, flexibility, and maintainability. 
- They let me take ownership of the product direction, which evolved into a frontend Javascript framework managed through a low-code UI.
	- We launched in beta earlier this year, and so far have had dozens of developers who turned away from anything deemed "low-code" acknowledge and understand that power of the system/tool.

**8base Product Organization Structuring**

The goal in my structuring of the 8base leadership organization is to make clear lines of responsibility between the different delivery groups. For a while, we were experiencing seriously internal issues in delivering product due to duplicated work and misalignment between delivery and design teams.

Our CEO is very design focused, from both an interface and system level. Therefore I structured the Product Design Team to include him, our CTO, lead UX/UI designer, and myself. Our responsibility and output being detailed visual and written specifications about what the products should do and how they should do it, per input collected from customers and a degree of internal product visioning. Our PM Director would partcipate, as he would be responsible for taking these assets to his Project Management Group.

The Project Management Groups responsibity and output is to translate Product Design assets to user stories and tasks, organize those in the Project Management system (JIRA) and then assign them to the approiate Project Manager + Enginnering Team. Project Managers that needed additional clarity or explanation could elevate those back to the design group, though when they felt they had a full understanding of what was being accomplished and how it benefitted our audience or system, they'd take it to the relevant team.

Engineering Teams work directly with a PM who is responsible for keeping the delivery of an Epic by a certain date. There are 3-teams that each focus on a core area of work (App Builder Backend, 8base Backend, and all Front-end).

- Product Design Team
	- Esteban
	- Albert
	- Tim
	- Julio
	- Me

- Product Management Team
	- Esteban
	- Maxim
	- Jorge

	- Maxim + Team
	- Jorge + Team
