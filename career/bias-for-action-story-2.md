## Question Wording
- **We don't always make the right decision all the time. Tell me about a time when you made a bad decision?** 
- **We don't always make the right judgment all the time. Tell me about a time when you made an error in judgment?** 
- **Tell me about a time when you discovered that your idea was not the best course of action?** 
    
    **S:** Earlier on at 8base – my current employer – we were experiencing a pretty steady flow of developer support emails that myself and several developers I managed were responsible for responding to/handling; there was no system in place for managing these in-bound requests. In light of our product centric responsibilities, our email response time wasn’t exactly the best. One email in particular that a customer sent directly to our CEO about not having received any support on an important bug for over a week is what finally tipped the scales, and made us all say “we need to do something about this.”
    
    **T:** My CEO told me that we need to implement a system and policy for handling support questions and ensuring a discrete response time.
    
    **A:** Given that these support tickets often required us asking many questions to diagnose the problem/solution, they were very conversational in nature. Any support request often having on average 6 messages back and forth. Therefore, I decided that the best way for handling these conversations was to create a public Slack community in which we could have live conversations with developers, as well as other developers with each other. This also felt like a great, low cost and highly actionable way to build better relationships with our developer community.
    
    **R:** However, immediately, our customers began expecting “real-time” communication and support, which we had no systems in-place to support being a US based company with a global customer-base. None of the incoming messages were organized or prioritized, allowing many messages to fall through the cracks as they got lost in the messaging feeds. And lastly, there was significant friction directing customers to sign-up for Slack and then join our channel, when they we’re reaching out via email. All that said, in retrospect, it was just a terrible solution to the problem. 
    
    As a result, I quickly recognized that my solution wasn’t good and it’s flaws would simply amplify as we scaled. However, it did surface for me two qualities **that needed** to be in the viable solution. These were:
    
    1. 24-hour accessibility/availability (providing support while we sleep)
    2. Organization/prioritization of support queries (allowing nothing to fall through the cracks)
    
    With these in-mind, I dug in on finding the most cost effective ways of solving this issue and ended up arriving at building a support forum community on Discourse. Doing so provided a very accessible and public platform for us to handling support conversations, which other users could then benefit from learning from or participating in around the clock. It alleviated us from the expectation of “chat-like” support, which we simply didn’t have the human capital/time resources to provide.  Additionally, it allowed us to organize around the tool, and easily gather insights around engagement, response times, and other metrics.
    
    This course correction ended up being a great solution which we still rely heavily on today. An unintended benefit of which was that all these support conversations are indexed by search engines, and has led to the community being one of our primary lead generation assets.
