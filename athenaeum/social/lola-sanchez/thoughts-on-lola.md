# Kept notes

You've developed a low opinion of yourself through my eyes. No matter what I say or do, you interpret it as me looking down at you or thinking poorly of you.

I'm bored of that. As you don't actually listen to anything I saw any more. Often, before I even finish speaking, you make up an opinion of what I said. It makes a lot of of conversations futile and fucking stupid.

I asked, "what are things you loved to do before We met?" You responded, "you think I'm boring?"

I asked on the phone, "is there anything else you'd like to talk about?" You responded, "I'm sorry for bothering you, good night."

Whenever I ask your opinion of something, you pretty much respond "what do you want." It's like you've become some meek little fucking mouse that can't open her mouth without stuttering in absolute horror.

I don't respect weakness. This "everything bruises me" attitude is fucking pathetic. If you want to keep it up, let's end this shit now. Everyone is insecure, fucking deal with it. You being on your period is the most boring excuse. If you're 10% of the person you project publically you'd being embarrassed to use such lame excuses as justifications for acting poorly.
