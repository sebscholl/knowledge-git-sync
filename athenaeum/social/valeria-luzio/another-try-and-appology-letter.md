# Another Try and Apology

Dear Valeria -

I love you dearly. Yet, I am grossly imperfect.

I’ve terribly communicated all of the ways that I dreamed to make our relationship exceptional. Everything I ever did – and thought I did – for our relationship has come from a place of love. I believe with certainty that you have also.

However, in struggling to make those dreams come true, I fell into negative patterns of behavior and communication. For a long time, I’ve felt like I failed us.

I’ve always explained things to you my way. However, I failed to consider whether my ideas were ones that you related to. You hating words like “responsibility”, “contribution”, and “sacrifice” in reference to our relationship is fully my fault. Those hurt feelings and emotions are because of how I’ve only communicated my ideas to you forcefully and too confidently from my own perspective.

I failed to take the time to understand what those words mean to you – in the context of us – and instead assumed that you didn’t “really” understand them, only because you didn’t agree with me.

I made some truly terrible mistakes. I’d like to acknowledge and own my mistakes. I don’t want you to torture yourself by wondering whether you “deserved” how I’ve behaved at important moments – regardless of any reasons by which I felt entitled to act as I did. You have not deserved to be treated as I have behaved.

**1. Silence**

My modes of silence aren’t fair. They’ve never been fair. They’re a defense mechanism that I falsely labeled as being “mature.” Really, it’s just me hiding. I get scared, insecure, angry, bruised, and confused. When I experience those emotions, the insecurity and uncertainty that I've allowed to get passed onto you has been unfair and mean. I’m sorry.

**2. Forever**

Me questioning and challenging our relationship when I did was cruel – each time it happened. Curiosity and honesty are at my core. That said, only things that we treat as special become and stay special. I’ve always loved our relationship; I’ve failed in many moments to treat it as something that’s truly special. The stress, pain, and confusion this caused you was never deserved. I failed to cherish and believe fully in something that deserved that attitude.

**3. Harsh love**

I grew up with harsh love. From that, I have poor, distant, and non-existent relationships with my family. I never dreamed of repeating that cycle and am scared of doing so. However, it’s clearly a trait I’ve reverted to in our difficult moments. While I’m proud of my own discipline, I’m embarrassed by my lack of lovingness towards you in moments that matter.

**4. Blind**

Being blind to when you have been scared, nervous, and need me has often made me a lacking partner. In difficult and challenging moments, my own intensity and focus has kicked-in, where I’ve become blind to you needing me. Instead, I foolishly blamed you for not being “like” me. I’m sorry for the times I left you feeling alone.

**5. Expectations**

We all have expectations. I’ve been an ass-hole with mine. My expectations got in the way of us being loving and happy. Being a person who gets so much joy out of a block of clay or $80 piano, I’m astonished by how brutally demanding and damaging my expectations have been on you – making you feel trapped, lacking, and un-loved. I made you feel like I hold disdain and pity towards you. That’s awful. I failed entirely at communicating my own love and excitement for seeing us grow and learn together. I am so sorry.

**6. Motherhood**

In that difficult moment that we decided to avoid parenthood, and the conversations we’ve had about needing to “change” before having children, I fear now that I’ve made you think I don’t believe you’d be a good mother. If so, this is the grossest way in which I’ve hurt and failed you. It is not something that I do believe nor have believed. I’ve only ever believed that we should take the opportunity to further grow and develop together before embarking into parenthood together. I never doubted your ability to be a wonderful mother when the time comes. I’m sorry, so deeply, for anyway in which I made you feel judged here.

We are both young, intelligent, vibrant, and passionate people. Neither of us have any future but a bright one ahead, should we each work for that future. I believe in you fully and love you deeply and profoundly. The few, few times that I’ve questioned your intent or integrity, I have only regretted doing so.

In this difficult moment that we are both going through, I want you to know that I truly love you and support you. **I believe in you, and trust that you will make the right decision with your own future in mind**. I believe you will make a decision that you will look back on and be proud of; seeing it as a moment that you felt fully powerful and in control of your life – after a while spent feeling lost.

It’s incredibly important to me that you discover peace, happiness, and an unshakable sense of fulfillment in your life. We’ve been acting in fear for far too long. I want the next chapter of both our lives to be triggered by courage and excitement.

If I am included in that proud vision you see for yourself, I’m honored. If not, I’ll always be here to support, help and encourage you in achieving the life you want for yourself. I want the best for you, unconditionally and without bounds.

I’m very sorry for the role I’ve played in us coming to where we are. I’m very optimistic – without expectation or bias – that the best future for both of us will spawn from it.

With un-shaken love,

Sebastian
