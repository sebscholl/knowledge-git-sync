# Divorce Notifying Letter

Valeria -

Part of our agreement to maintain your immigration status depended on both of us exercising discretion when it comes to our online presence.

I've kept my personal Instagram private, as well as avoided posting photos that would suggest I'm with someone, or traveling with someone, other than you.

Given my own risk for being convicted of marriage fraud in our situation, I've made a point to check your Instagram on a monthly basis. I regret to tell you that the following has made me know longer comfortable with our arrangement:

1. Your profile and stories are public.
2. You've posted photos with a new boyfriend.
3. You posting photos of exotic, romantic travel, which I'm obviously not on.

You went public. I told you that's not acceptable. I'm vulnerable now. I need a divorce.

Sebastian
