These are my thoughts as I prepare to tell Valeria that we should break up.

We're both stupid. I believe that is something we should accept, and keep in mind, throughout all of this. We both are terrible at foreseeing what's best, predicating how the other will respond, and most of all communicating. So at this low point that we are at, my thoughts have **nothing** to do with what's the best or smartest decision. Instead, all I'm thinking about is "how do I make a decision that protects me and you, individually the most from being wrong?"

For as we've learned about ourselves during our relationship, both of us are usually wrong.

We really have two options; break up or stay together. Both of us want some sense of security and certainty in our lives. Neither of us have found it with one another for a long time in our relationship. While "break up" is somewhat (or seemingly) definitive, "stay together" is a choice that we must continually make every day. 

"Stay together" is the choice that has been weighing down so hard on us. It is the reason why we've for so long not known how to act, as in the back of our minds that commitment has been eating away at us. Why? Because if that wasn't a problem, we wouldn't be having discussions around whether we want to be together - we'd only be discussing how do we get passed our obstacles.

Because of these two options, we really have one questions to ask ourselves; "Do I absolutely want to spend the rest of my life with this person, no matter what?" I don't believe that either of us can - at this point - answer that question with certainty, or promise the other person in honesty, with a resounding yes.

In our most recent best moments, we can both most certainly say "maybe." In our worst moments, as we've now both demonstrated to one another multiple times, the answer is "no."

Don't forget how stupid we are. And that, essentially, we're trying to protect ourselves from making the worst decision. Right now, there are four hypothetical outcomes from this decision.

1. Stay Together + Happy = We decide to stay together, everything changes and we soon discover happy and fulfilled lives.
2. Stay Together + Miserable = We decide to stay together, nothing changes and we continue to live sad, angry, and wish we broke up.
3. Break Up + Happy = We decide to break up, both realize that it was the right decision and soon discover happy and fulfilled lives.
4. Break Up + Miserable = We decide to break up, we continue to live sad, angry, and wish we broke up because we realize that it was the wrong decision.

We've been in the Stuck Cycle,  where we've kept looping through *Stay Together + Miserable* and *Break Up + Miserable.* As every-time we've jumped through a cycle in quick succession (4-times in 2019). Knowing this we know that there if we make commit to the tough decision now (break the cycle), we will either go straight into *Break up + Happy* and the future, or suffer an actual *Break up + Miserable* cycle and then loop to *Stay Together + Happy*.  

What's most important here, above the relationship and individuals, is **not *Staying Together or Breaking Up.*** It is 100% achieving *Happy* in the future. If both people can achieve happy in the future, then the right decision was made. And when looking at the flow chart, this mental model does NOT get ever used when a couple (or separated individuals) are in a ST+H or BU+H environment. It is only ever applied or useful when a two people find themselves paralyzed by not knowing whether they are in a relationship that's worthwhile.
