# The Rust Programming Language 


### 1.3 Hello, Cargo

Cargo is a combination of the build system and package manager. 

Use Cargo to create new Rust programs.

```sh
cargo new project_name
```

> NOTE: Cargo automatically initializes a git repo. 

#### Cargo Commands
#rust/cargo/commands

```sh
# Build the project (executable stored in target/debug/project_name)
cargo build

# Build and run the project
cargo run

# Build without producing executable
cargo check
```

Building for release is different than development. Further optimizations are created in the release build.

```sh
# Build release (executable in target/release/project_name)
cargo build --release
```
