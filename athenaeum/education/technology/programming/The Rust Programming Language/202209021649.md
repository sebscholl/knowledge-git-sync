### 1.3 Hello, Cargo

Cargo is a combination of the build system and package manager. 

Use Cargo to create new Rust programs.

```sh
cargo new project_name
```

> NOTE: Cargo automatically initializes a git repo. 

#### Cargo Commands
#rust/cargo/commands

```sh
# Build the project (executable stored in target/debug/project_name)
cargo build

# Build and run the project
cargo run

# Build without producing executable
cargo check
```

Building for release is different than development. Further optimizations are created in the release build.

```sh
# Build release (executable in target/release/project_name)
cargo build --release
```

## Programming a Guessing Game
#rust/basics

`use` us rge import keyword for libraries and modules. Nested imports use double colon syntax. Example, `use std::io`.

> NOTE: functions ending with a bang ("!") are called macros and have different behavior than functions.

By default, variables are immutable. Use the `mut` keyword to declare a variable as mutable.

```rust
let apples = 5; // immutable
let mut bananas = 5; // mutable
```

`&` indicates a *reference* in rust, which means that it allows multiple areas of the code to access a single piece of data without copying the data into memory multiple times.  Even if the referenced variable is mutable, the reference itself is not. Therefore, it's required to make it mutable explicitly:

```rust
# Mutable reference
io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
```

Rust will automatically detect certain uncaught errors for you and enforce exception handling. For example:

```sh
$ cargo build Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game) warning: unused `Result` that must be used --> src/main.rs:10:5 | 10 | io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess); | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ | = note: `#[warn(unused_must_use)]` on by default = note: this `Result` may be an `Err` variant, which should be handled warning: `guessing_game` (bin "guessing_game") generated 1 warning Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.59s
```

### Importing Packages/Libraries
#rust/cargo/commands 

Add dependencies in the cargo.toml file explicitly.

Cargo knows when your dependencies have or haven't changed, leading to faster builds between `src` code changes.

```sh
# Updates the Cargo.lock file with latest versions
cargo update
```

Imports can be "Scoped" to where you still use the main library name but it only loads a subsect of methods. These are called *Traits*. For example:

```rust
use rand::Rng
// Loads range methods ON rand module
let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
```

> Note: You won’t just know which traits to use and which methods and functions to call from a crate, so each crate has documentation with instructions for using it. Another neat feature of Cargo is that running the `cargo doc --open` command will build documentation provided by all of your dependencies locally and open it in your browser. If you’re interested in other functionality in the `rand` crate, for example, run `cargo doc --open` and click `rand` in the sidebar on the left.

The `match` expression has different *arms* which are patterns it tries to match against. There are different types of *arms* depending on what values attempt to be matched.

When using `parse()` method, Rust infers the type based on the annotation of the variable it's being set to. For example:

```rust
let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
```

### Handling invalid inputs

Different functions in rust essentially have a callback that can be used to map the `Ok(result)` and `Err(er)` returns. Syntactically, it's similar to a function map.

```rust
// INCLUDE MATCH KEYWORD
let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() { 
	Ok(num) => num, 
	Err(_) => continue, 
};
```

## Variables and Mutability

Convention in rust uses upcase and underscore in constant names. Constants are **always** immutable (`const MY_CONSTANT: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;`). What's important to is that this constant value is calculated at build time, meaning that you can write out the expression in a more human-readable format without it affecting the programs performance with added operations.

When *shadowing* a variable (re-assigning its value to the same name on a non-mutable variable), you must restate the `let` keyword:

```rust
let x = 5;
let x = x + 1;
```

> NOTE: A shadowed variable can also have different values between two scopes and the same name.

## Data Types

In statically types languages all variables types must be known at compile time.

**Scalar Types** - A _scalar_ type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

**Integer Types in Rust**

> NOTE: _Signed_ and _unsigned_ refer to whether it’s possible for the number to be negative (has a SIGN or doesn't).

Length | Signed | Unsigned
8-bit | i8 | u8
16-bit |	 i16 |	u16
32-bit	| i32 | u32
64-bit	| i64	| u64
128-bit |	i128 | u128
arch	| isize | usize

**Char Types**

```rust
fn main() {     
	let c = 'z';     
	let z: char = 'ℤ'; // with explicit type annotation     
	let heart_eyed_cat = '😻'; 
}`
```

>Note that we specify `char` literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes. Rust’s `char` type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid `char` values in Rust. Unicode Scalar Values range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive. However, a “character” isn’t really a concept in Unicode, so your human intuition for what a “character” is may not match up with what a `char` is in Rust. We’ll discuss this topic in detail in [“Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-02-strings.html#storing-utf-8-encoded-text-with-strings) in Chapter 8.

**Compound Tuple**
```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

Array's are best used when you know the number of elements will not need to change.

```rust
fn main() {
	let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

## Functions

All function arguments **MUST** be typed. 

Rust distinguishes between *statements* and *expressions*.

A *statement* is an instruction that does not return ant value. An *expression* evaluates to a resulting value.

Unlike in Ruby or Python, there is NO implicit return value in a statement, like setting a variable returns the variable.

In rust, *expressions* are things like functions and macros. They return a value. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
	// New scope block is an expression returning it's last line
	let y = {
        let x = 3;
        // This expression DOES NOT end with a semi colon. Semicolon would denote it as a statement.
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

Return values in functions get a declared type denoted after an arrow.

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```
