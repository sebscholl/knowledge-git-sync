# Amazon L6 Product Manager


**Things to highlight about me:**

- Track record of turning ambiguous ideas into products and delivering novel cloud services
	- Discuss the RampEX journey being relevant to Amazon Connect in empowering front-line call center employees 
	- Connect is cool, because it's helping address the painpoint that so many of Amazon's customer's customers dislike the most about any experience...contacting support!

PM's job is NOT to have the vision:
- It's to contribute to the vision
- Refine the vision
- Easily communicate the vision to all stakeholders
- PM Leadership is about coaching PM's and enabling them to take things to fruition
- PM Soldiers are responsible for seeing the PM vision through to fruition
- To PMs **PRODUCT IS PROCESS**
	- PM's don't code or design. They orchestrate coder's and designers.
	- It's their job to establish and manage effective processes so that product materializes without their direct input.
- Understanding:
	- How to validate product
	- How to validate ideas
	- How to validate MVP
	- How to track status
	- How to get feedback
