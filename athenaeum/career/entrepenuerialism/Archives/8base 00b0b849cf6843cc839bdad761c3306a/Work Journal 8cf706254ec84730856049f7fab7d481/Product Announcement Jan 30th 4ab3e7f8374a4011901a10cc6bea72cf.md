# Product Announcement Jan 30th

Created: January 27, 2020 10:07 AM

Happy New Year! How has the new year kicked off for you? On our side, it's been heads down at TechStars in Austin, TX. This accelerator has beenÂ **immensely valuable**Â â€“ to say the least â€“ as it continues to help us refine 8base's growth strategy while making invaluable introductions.

That said, whether we're heads up or down, we've still got to keep pushing the train forward! As a steady flow of developers continues to subscribe, and new businesses approach our solutions team,Â *time*Â is becoming an even more precious commodity. However, as always, we'd love to share several of the most notable developments from January with you!

**Combine REST APIs in GraphQL Using 8base**

Sebastian hopped on Twitch with Jason Lengstorf to do a Learn with Jason episode. Developers worldwide tuned-in to learn about combining REST APIs into GraphQL using 8base in a 90-minute live stream thatÂ [you can watch here](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/combine-rest-apis-in-graphql-using-8base).

**Using "Loose Typings" in GraphQL for Grouping and Aggregation Queries**

A substantial technical development that has gone live on 8base is the ability to do grouping and aggregations using the API. TheÂ [GraphQL Weekly newsletter shared this as their #1 story](https://www.graphqlweekly.com/issues/175/)Â the week of January 9th.

# **Product**

**Grouping and Aggregations**

As mentioned, grouping and aggregations are huge feature advancements for the 8base GraphQL API. So many of our own projects and customers have needed this capability. Now, it's live. Also, as far as we know, we are the onlyÂ [GraphQL API with a full-featured grouping and aggregations](https://docs.8base.com/docs/8base-console/graphql-api/grouping-and-aggregations/)Â capability.

**72 Other Feature Improvements**

We pushed out 72 minor-feature updates and improvements to the product over the past month. Every one of which enhanced our service, while being unnamed and silent heroes.

# **Growth**

**8base Labs**

The new year kicked-off very strong on the 8base Labs side of things. However, besides the latest projects we've both closed and have in-process, seeing referrals come from our current customers is most exciting. To us, this has been hugely validating of how much our customers believe in the service we offer.

**THANKS**

We hope you found this exciting and interesting! Please, keep the feedback coming, and we will continue to strive at knocking your socks off with excellent news and features.
