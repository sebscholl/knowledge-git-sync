Our thesis

- The problem
    - For those who do it, software development is hard. For those who don't, it's seemingly impossible. Too many great ideas for software applications never come to fruition because the

I want to see a office with a clock on the wall that is actually showing the real time. There should be a window in the office, and outside the window should reflect the time of day in the users part of the world.

TESTIMONIALS

THE PROBLEM

When building software, **80% of the time and money available** tends to get **spent developing systems and integrations** that aren't unique to the project. For example, secure authentication, a hosted database, and file storage are **not unique application requirements**. However, most project's **development focus** goes to **identifying, configuring, integrating**, and **maintaining** such **systems**. Meanwhile, only **20% is left** to focus on the **core innovation**. This ends up **negatively effecting everyone** in both the short-term and long-term.

THE SOLUTION

8base **flips that equation** to make sure that the **80% focus shifts to** **innovation**. We provide a **best-practice software architecture** that gets managed **on AWS** and has all application resources instantly available through a **single API endpoint**. This gives **software teams** a **streamlined development** experience on a battle-tested and **flexible foundation**, to which **any application interface can connect**. As a result, little to **no development** time ****gets **spent** on the things that are **not unique to the project.** This leads to **faster delivery**, hiring **less specialized resources**, and **predictably quality** outcomes.

VIDEO SCRIPT

There are infinite ways to solve today's challenges using software. That's where entrepreneurial-minded people, like you, often see the biggest opportunities to drive change.

Maybe you're leading a team at work to build a web or desktop customer experience. Maybe you're building an amazing mobile app for a startup. Maybe you're creating a mesh of IoT devices that will help manufacturers conserve energy.

Whatever it is, you need a strategy to bring the idea into reality.

100s of tools exist for building user interfaces, but what about setting up a backend? Spinning up servers, managing databases, securing APIs, storing images and videos, safely authenticating users, establishing deployment processes... as they say, the list goes on...

Whether or not you're a technical whiz, the whole process is really hard and often intimidating.

That's why we built 8base.

8base is the fastest way to build innovative software and turn application ideas into seamless cross-platform experiences.

Want to store relational data in the cloud? Securely authenticate users? Integrate multiple data sources? Harness the power of GraphQL?

8base gives you all of that and more instantly, pre-configured on AWS and available through a single API endpoint.

Need to conquer ambitious projects with a limited team? 8base gives normal developers the capabilities of backend specialists and is dev-ops free - allowing your team to confidently move at lightning speeds.

Plan to support 1,000,000's of concurrent users? 8base scales infinitely on top of a proven server-less cloud architecture. All of that is easily managed through a single intuitive web interface.

8base is all about making sure that innovators get to focus on innovation. We do that by providing A streamlined and intuitive development experience for building powerful backend applications on AWS. Allowing you to accomplish more, while requiring less.

Innovate as fast as you can ideate, with 8base.
