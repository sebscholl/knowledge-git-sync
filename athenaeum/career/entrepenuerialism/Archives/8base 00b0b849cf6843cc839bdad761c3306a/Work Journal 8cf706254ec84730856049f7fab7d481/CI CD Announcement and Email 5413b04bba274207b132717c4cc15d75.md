Subject: We're deleting in-active 8base workspaces in 90-days!

Hi <First-name>

In 90-days from today (<actual calendar date>) at 12:00am, 8base is going to permanently delete any workspace that meets **ALL** of the following 3 criteria.

1. No console activity since <date>.
2. No API activity since <date>.
3. No paid subscription.

If you have a workspace that you wish to keep developing, simply [login to the console](https://app.8base.com) and get at it! Otherwise, you'll always have one free workspace to use with your account.

Thank you!

Subject: 8base Releases Integrated CI/CD for Professional Plan

Hey <first-name> - We have some exciting news to tell you! 

The 8base team has worked tirelessly on developing a Continuous Integration & Deployment capability (CI/CD) that's native to the platform. After many months of development and testing, we're excited to announce that it has been released as part of the [Professional Plan](https://www.8base.com/pricing).

**What does this mean for your development project?**

CI/CD allows a developer to create multiple environments for a single workspace; environments like *Development*, *Staging*, and *Production*. This allows you to safely develop new backend resources, merge them into a testing environment, and then deploy them to production once everything's working! For software applications being used by real-world customers, CI/CD is extremely important.

If you're curious about CI/CD, feel free to checkout the documentation!

As always, we'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback. Don't hesitate to respond to this email with questions or ideas regarding CI/CD.

Happy Developing
