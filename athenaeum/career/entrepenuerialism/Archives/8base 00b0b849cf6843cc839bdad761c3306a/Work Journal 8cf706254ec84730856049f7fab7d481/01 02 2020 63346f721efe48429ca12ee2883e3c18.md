Copying Notes over from Notepad:

Startup Founders are the worst potential opportunity we could pursue. 90% of startups fail. Only 5% of failures ([https://www.failory.com/blog/startup-failure-rate](https://www.failory.com/blog/startup-failure-rate)) are associated with bad products. And of the few that workout and scale, they will (most likely) more to have in-house teams and move away from 8base for better pricing.

“Customer value grows like wine ages” = How does 8base get in now to Techstars companies.
