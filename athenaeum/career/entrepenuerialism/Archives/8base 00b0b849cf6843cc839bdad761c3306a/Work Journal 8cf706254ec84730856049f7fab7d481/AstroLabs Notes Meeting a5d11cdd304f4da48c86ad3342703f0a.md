# AstroLabs Notes Meeting

Created: January 3, 2020 12:02 PM

Massive shared database of Sneaker Collections. It serves as a profile experience.

1. List of Shoes you Own
2. List of Shoes you Want
3. List of Trade History

Existing platforms do buy and sell. For now, you they are doing a sneaker has to exist on either side. 

Every collector has shoes they have and shoes they want. Has a "Feed" (Uber list) all shoes in the database. Whenever you see something you like, two actions - soft interest, hard interest.

In the data-model, generic grid (make and model), physical grid (size, color, etc). AstroLabs is the shoe handler, they manage the shipping and processing. They need a way of handling the trade (bad, good, unsure).

Biggest issue is verification. That is their specialty. Need to have a verification flow.

The more a user is a collector the more dead stock they have (brand new). The goal is to emphasize the trade, not the monetary value. So the focus is on the barter, not the market value of the trade.

The two upload options is deadstock and used. Deadstock selects from list of existing catalog while used requires user photos.
