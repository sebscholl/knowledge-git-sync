The Must Answer Questions (DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT TEAM CONSENSUS)

```
(1) Who is our target audience?
	(a) "ANSWER HERE"	

	*THINK* How many of them have we talked to one-on-one?

(2) What problem are we solving for our target audience?
	(a) High level: "ANSWER HERE" 
	(b) Product level: "ANSW is the best app ER HERE" 
	(c) Feature level: "ANSWER HERE" 

(3) What is our value proposition?
	(a) "ANSWER HERE" 

(4) What is our benefits statement?
	(a) "ANSWER HERE" 

(5) What do we want to be known for?
	(a) "ANSWER HERE" 

	*THINK* The market will never let you solve multiple problems if you can't just solve one?
	*THINK* Is our customer experience the problem we solve, or is it someone involved/related to them?
```

Building Personas - Who do we talk to?

```
(1) Identify 3 personas and 3 problems they all share.

(2) Build a list of all the problems the product solves.

Content - What Content does Marketing Produce

```
Essential Content Types:
