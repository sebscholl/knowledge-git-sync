# Build Your Startup Campaign

# Overview

*The Ultimate App Competition* is a global entrepreneurial challenge that’s sponsored by 8base. Interested persons are encouraged to complete a short online application, in which they are asked to explain their app idea and how 8base’s platform might be its unique enabler. The winner will be awarded a complementary engagement, where 8base Labs will design, develop, and deploy an application on their behalf.

Applicants will be given a unique URL that they are asked to share on a daily basis with their online/offline networks. The URL exposes a page that is customized with specific sections of their application, as well as a voting mechanism. Supporters of an applicant are allowed to vote **once every 24-hours**. While 8base’s team will select a winner based on a discrete evaluation rubric, only the top 50 voted applications will be reviewed.

The competition will run for 60-days, after which the winner will be selected within 7-days. Once selected, 8base Labs will kick off the application design and development process. It’s required that the winner allow 8base to promote and prepare marketing content that leverages deliverables in the engagement (i.e. designs, code samples, exciting features). Such content will be published to further engage/nurture relationships with competition applicants.

# Application

The competition’s application will require both text and video inputs. Optionally, applicants will be able to submit a pitch deck to further support enhance application. While all applicants are welcome to apply, certain “idea” categories will be disqualified programmatically (while still allowing the applicant to apply, share their link, and promote the competition.)

Such disqualified categories may include ideas that require:

- Blockchain
- Hardware
- Licensing
- Regulatory approval

Applicants should be able to complete their application in approximately 20 to 30-minutes with ease.

# Voting Page

Once an application has been submitted, a voting page with a unique URL will be generated for the applicant. The page will be customized with information collected in the application, as well as publicly display any uploaded media. By editing their application, the applicant will be able to go in and update any information being displayed publicly.

The voting mechanism on the voting page will allow any visitor to vote once per day in support of the idea. It will track the voters IP address, and reset every 24-hours. The number of votes collected will be displayed on each application’s voting page. However, there will be no leaderboards are *search* feature. All page traffic must be gathered through direct traffic by sharing the unique page link.

All video submissions are required to be uploaded to YouTube and contain titles with the following anatomy:

*“8base Ultimate App Competition: [APPLICANT APP NAME] Submission”*

# Grading

Of all applications received, only the top 50 - as ranked by number of votes - will be reviewed and eligible to win. For those applications that do make the top 50, applicants will be scored on the following criteria and transparently receive the feedback.

**Potential Impact (1 to 10):** How big of an impact could the app have on people’s lives? How big or small is the anticipated market?

**Sustainability (1 to 10):** Is the proposed idea a sustainable one? Will it be able to generate enough revenue to support its owner, a small business, an enterprise, a new market?

**Disruptiveness (1 to 10):** How disruptive is the idea? Is it going to challenge this status quo, or jump in the current stream?

**Market Opportunity (1 to 10):** Is there a market for the proposed solution? Is the timing right/too late/too soon?

**Applicability (1 to 10):** Is the idea well suited for 8base? How perfect of a fit is 8base’s platform to enable the app idea?

Using the proposed grading criteria, a perfect score would be 50/50. The top 50 applicants will be ranked on a curve for their voting scores. The final score will be weighed 50% and 50% between the grading score and voting score.

**Example scenario:**

Imagine that the top three voted applicants received the following number of votes.

- Applicant A: 20,000 votes
- Applicant B: 17,500 votes
- Applicant C: 15,000 votes

Before receiving grades, each applicant would be scored as follows:

- Applicant A: 50%
- Applicant B: 43.75%
- Applicant C: 37.5%

In such a scenario, Applicant B would have to receive a grade that’s 7-points or more higher than Applicant A to win.

Marketing

*The Ultimate App Competition* will be heavily marketed by 8base through social, ad, and partner channels. Utilizing relationship, like WeWork, General Assembly, Miami Angles, CIC, Flatiron, and others, we will encourage 8base’s large network to not only participate with it’s own ideas, but promote the competition and vote on submissions.

A campaign page will be added to *8base.com/ultimate-app-competition* that will describe the competition in full and display the *apply* button; providing any necessary legal disclaimers necessary. This page will not only display text and rich media assets, but all a video describing the competition. The video will be shareable across all social channels (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube) and be targeted at persons engaged in app development and entrepreneurial communities.

Additionally, through local media outlets that Albert has relationships with, the competition can be further promoted through Miami/national media outlets.

While 8base will be heavily engaged in the promotion of the competition, its true “viral factor” will come from the daily voting mechanism. **Serious applicants will be urged to ask their networks to vote for their app ideas on a daily basis.** This results in a constant barrage of social media activity, sending traffic to the application page (hosted on *8base.com/ultimate-app-competition/app/<APP_SLUG>*) where visitors will be able to vote, apply with their own idea, and learn more about 8base.

Content

The greatest inspiration for *UAC* is telling the story of taking an idea from inception to deployment. As soon as a winner gets selected, 8base will engage them on creating the following content pieces.

- Winner Announcement (video):
    - A video interview of 8base and the winner, talking about how excited they are to be working with 8base to bring their idea into reality. This piece is really about emphasizing the excitement of the entrepreneur/winner, as well as taking the opportunity to explain to them (the viewers) what the next steps are and why they should follow the story.
- Design review (blog):
    - Once the initial design sprint is done, a blog post will be released showing the design work that has been done and explaining the inspiration for the designs, as well as any difficult or interesting questions that had to be answered in the sprint.
    - If possible, the Invision prototype will be made public for followers to interact with and share their own opinions on how it looks/feels.
- Data Model Development (1-hour live-coding):
    - One of the first development content pieces will be a 1-hour live coding session of building the data-model in 8base of the application. The goal here is to show followers how approachable of a tool the 8base backend is. This may encourage them to give 8base a shot on their own.
- Challenge Blog (2 blogs):
    - We will create two different blog posts about challenges that are being faced during development that 8base has uniquely been able to handle. For example, using grouping and aggregation to handle complex database queries, and developing a plugin to encapsulate reusable logic.
    - This content will be targeted at the more technical segments of our audience.
- First Review (video):
    - In this video we will do a live review with the winner where they will get to test out and try their app for the first time. It will be on a staging server, and we will be able to take their questions and concerns back to the team to make and changes needed.
    - The goal of this video is to be a check-in with the winner, as well as make viewers see how collaborative the 8base development cycle is. It would also be a great gimmick in this video for the winner to ask “can we change X in the data model or app” and in seconds that change be made live.
- Launch (blog / video):
    - This effort will be to promote the built application to the subscriber list and interested communities. While the blog post will talk about the app, the video will be a discussion with the winner about a) how did the development effort go? What were they scared of? What did they learn? What went well? Are they happy they did it? And b) What their plans are now that the app is launched!

**Call with Heather Dunn DLA Piper**

November 18, 2019

We need to firm up the actual prize.

One thing we really need to be careful about is setting up an illegal lottery. A prize with value, where the selection of the prize is based on chance. If chance is a significant portion of the winning prize, it is a lottery. If there is a cost or time or effort, that is considered payment to participate in the prize.

If the rules and selection are clear, then it is not an illegal lottery.

We need to set it up as a skilled contest. How to break a tie. And judged by qualified judges. We may think about a combination of inside and outside judges. The main issue that comes up is with a disgruntled loser.

Pick your jurisdictions and then rules for that. There are countries that it is not legal. There are countries where there is a tax issue. There could be IP issues. Heather suggests we do not open this up globally and just keep it to the US.

We need a set of official rules. We need abbreviated disclosures. We need rules to administer it and to archive it.
