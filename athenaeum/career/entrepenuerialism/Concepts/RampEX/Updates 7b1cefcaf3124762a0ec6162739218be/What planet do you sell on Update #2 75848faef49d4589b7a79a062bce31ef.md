# What planet do you sell on?: Update #2

Shortly after sending last months update I received half a dozen replies that all begged answer to the same question... "What is RampEX, actually?". They came as a surprise. For months I'd confidently assumed that the company's "Automated Role-play Simulator" slogan concisely said it all. In retrospect, that was a silly assumption.

When building an abstract product, it's very easy to unconsciously build an abstract world in which it perfectly exists. One where new lexicons are invented and existing ones redefined to enable better the articulation of a creators creation. Sometimes, in minds of those most hopefull, even basic human tendencies are reassumed to better compliment their hypothesis' yet proven. I may have fallen slightly prone to the later.

Excluding Elon Musk, us other 6,999,999,999 humans are limited to building businesses below the clouds for the foreseeable future. That logically suggests I should deliberately remind myself to not float off the planet when handling a very important matter; communicating my work at RampEX.

To that end, here is a marketing-speak-less description of RampEX. It starts with some important concepts before moving to the product and then where we're at. On Sunday I have dinner with my Grandmother who will likely have read this. I'll feel vindicated depending on her ability to explain RampEX to me.

Concept #1 - Practice vs. Coaching.

Imagine that you decide to learn golf. By chance, at that same moment Tiger Woods knocks on your door to say he'd like to share with you everything he knows about golf. You let him in, pour some coffee, and for the next month spend 8-hours a day absorbing every shred of knowledge he picked up during his iconic career.

After all that osmosis from an unparalleled expert, you'll walk away a spectacularly terrible golfer. Why? Because practice is what makes perfect. There are no known substitutes.

So following that month you call back Tiger to explain how you haven't improved a day. He agrees to give you one more day of his time, but now at a driving range. You go and have him coach you after every swing. 8-hours later, you're a better golfer than a full year of coffee and osmosis would have made you. Why? Because you were actually doing the thing you wanted to learn; you were practicing.

Concept #2 - Where Professionals Training Fails

The New England Patriots decide to draft a new batch rookies. They approach several universities and hand pick the top intramural sports players. After signing contracts, all the recruits get handed playbooks and are instructed to memorize them before next week's game day. There'll be one or two practices during the first week, but after that everyone will be expected to figure it out on the field.

Now ask yourself a simple question. How do you imagine this season will play out for the Patriots?

You're likely thinking "that's not how it works..." You're right. Not only would the Patriots recruit the crém de le crém of collegiate football talent, but have those elites in the gym seven days a week strength training, running drills endlessly during practice untill execution is flawless, and being coached individually to improves their strengths and weaknesses. The dedication and focus given to preparation is what makes a professional athlete extraordinary at their job.

Now this is what happens In the business world.

BigBusiness Inc. decides to hire a new cohort of rookies. They approach many universities, post job ads, and select a varied group of promising candidates. After signing employment agreements, everyone gets employee handbooks and are asked to look them over. They'll be some training and onboarding activities during the first week, but after that everyone is expected to continue learning on the job.

How do you imagine this quarter will play out for BigBusiness Inc.? Likely not so well unless they are shooting for unpreparedness and high turnover.

Concept #3 - Simulated Experience

Before a pilot ever takes an aircraft off the ground they'll have logged hundreds of hours in a flight simulator. Not because they like videogames, but because a good flight simulator so closely...simulates the real thing. By treating it seriously, a pilot can gain experience handling real world scenarios without being exposed to life threatening concequences. This way when they're in the air and loose an engine, no sweat (okay, less sweat), they've successfully dealt with it before.

RampEX: What is it, actually?

When introducing Concept #1, you were able to practice your golf game on a driving. In Concept #2 the athletes had access to a gym and practice field. The pilots in Concept #3 used a flight simulator. Where do business professional go to practice? The honest answer is to their next customer interaction.

What RampEX is actually doing is trying to fix that. We're building products and platforms that give business professionals the same opportunities to meaningfully practice, like our athletes and pilots have. Our first product that launched in December is a simulator. This is what it looks like inside and out (literally).

Using Virtual Reality, we can put a business professional whereever they need to be. Using Artificial Intelligence, we can make avatars act like customers. Using paraphrasing, I can make all that sound a whole lot simpler than doing it actually is. However, what's important to know is that RampEX can simulate real world business scenarios. Meaning professionals get their very simulator.

By using RampEX, professionals develop skills faster. Not only because they can practice more often and do so deliberately, but also because our software watches them practice and coaches them on how to improve.

Last month we put RampEX in a Century21 office. The company has new agents go on simulated listing presentation meetings, helping them develop the confidence and familiarity needed to sell a core product of theirs. After every simulated listing presentation, the agent is reported back how well they did on things like maintaining eye contact with customers (avatars), answering questions, and using key phrases. Based on that information, RampEX then tells them, "Next time, focus on this".

Where we're at.

We're in talks with several household name companies that are excited about our technology. On top of that, these early conversations have uncovered another hugely beneficial training product that's already been put into development. Over the next few months the focus will continue to be on feedback driven product improvement, fundraising, and bringing in some of the company's first team members. However, those updates are to come.
