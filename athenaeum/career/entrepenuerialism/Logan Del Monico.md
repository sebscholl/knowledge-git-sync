"There's not enough hours to meet everyone. Thus, we must distinguish ourselves so that every encounter is one of formidable respect. Logan Del Monico."

"A bracelet, ring, or necklace isn't enough to get the girl. However, it's enough to intrigue her. And that's the first step."

"There are many things that money can't buy, fortunately jewelry is not one of them."

Logan Del Monico is a Miami born artist who developed his passion for jewelry and sculpture on his lifelong pursuit of adventure and travel.  Through his exposure to art and culture from Asia to the Americas, Logan Del Monico’s creative expression is guided by an observed humanistic thread that eclipses any one culture.  Combining form, anatomy, and function, his designs, signature art work, and jewelry embody individualism, strength, and vulnerability.

The LDM brand was founded in 2019 by sculptor, Logan Del Monico, and entrepreneur friend, Travis Hammond.  Today, Logan focuses largely on sculpture art, while working closely with Travis to design and develop one-of-a-kind jewelry in collaboration with specialized artisans in the US, Italy, and Indonesia.

Producers of fine jewelry and sculpture art. The house designs and manufactures one-of-a-kind art inspired pieces that combine form, anatomy, and function. Every Logan Del Monico piece is an artwork, emboding individualism, strength, and vulnerability. ,

Vermeil; ver-may

Our Vermeil jewelry is made by applying a thick layer of 18K gold onto our Sterling Silver designs.

To best care for your Vermeil jewelry, we suggest:

¤ Gentle cleaning with a dry cloth.
¤ Removal during exercise and sweat.
¤ Avoid wearing in chlorine and salt water.
¤ Applying colognes or creams separately.

Number 4 standard lengths (1, 2, 3 ,4) so that layering is easily achieved without measuring.

Jewelry making is a romantic confluence of art and science. Every Logan Del Monico creation orchestrates the varied talents of skilled artisans; lapidaries, sculptors, stone setters, metal casters and story tellers among them. Logan's exclusive designs are story pieces that embody humanistic symbolisms and a masculine aesthetic.

Day 1 - Order Confirmation

Subject: Thank you for your purchase! The journey starts now.

Thank you for your purchase, (First Name).

I'm thrilled to have this opportunity to share Logan Del Monico's creations with you; from my hands to yours.

Every single Logan Del Monico creation orchestrates the varied talents of skilled artisans; among them are lapidaries, sculptors, stone setters, metal casters and story tellers. This process is our passion, and I'd like to share that passion with you as our team create your pieces.

A number of precious earthly materials are about to pass through many masters' time-worn hands and end up in yours. Please look forward to our email updates of that journey.

With thanks
Logan

Day 2 - Production Started

Subject: The process has begun

Dear (First Name)

A principle production technique for Logan Del Monico jewelry is the Lost Wax Casting Method.

The process involves taking a wax model of the jewelry design and incasing it in a single-use plaster mold. The plaster mold is then flipped upside-down and baked, allowing the wax to melt and flow out. What's left is an empty cavity, in which molten metal can be poured.

Our metal casters have pulled the molds & created the models required to make waxes for your pieces. Soon, they'll get casted in the appropriate metal.

With thanks
Logan

Day 6 - Tumble, Cleaning and Polishing

Subject: Casted and ready for cleaning

Dear (First Name)

Your pieces have been casted! It's now time for them to get cleaned and tumbled.

Newly casted jewelry has a crude and imperfect appearance. Sprues added to create channels from the plaster mold's surface to the wax model must be sawed off. Any imperfections need to be filed or sanded away.

Once the jewelry is cleaned, it will be placed in a rotating drum for up to 24-hours, along with small pieces of stainless steel. The crashing bits of stainless steel hardens the jewelry, adding to the metal's strength and durability.

With thanks
Logan

Day 8 - Soldering, stone setting, and buffing

Subject: This is the final step

Dear (First Name)

Your pieces have been cleaned and tumbled! Depending on their design, special attention and expertise is required prior to a final buff and polish.

If multiple components must be fused together to form a single piece, the jeweler will spark their torch and begin soldering.

If a design feature gemstones, settings are precisely measured, drilled, shaped, and readied to securely fasten each stone.

Leather accents, micro-mosaics, engravings and other features each demand equally intense involvement.

After all features have been added and inspected for exceeding quality, the creation is buffed and polished.

Day 10 - Boxed and Shipped

Subject: Your order has been shipped

Jewelry is a process. One of constant practice and refined craftsmanship and creative output. Throughout that process many imperfect treasures are made: though treasures nonetheless. At LDM, we care as much about our process as our products, which is why we share our prototypes and practice pieces with you.

Each one is made in by hand and one of a kind. Much of our design process is done with brass before we invest in precious metals. Therefore, many of these pieces are constructed or poured using white and yellow jewelers brass.

Designing pieces for men that give pleasure to women.

All men should strive to have their heart broken by a beautiful woman.

To have his heart broken is a man's first right of passage in romance. To break a heart, is his second.

Greek Colluseum Ring

"I want to take a photo of a bohemian scene with large thick golden picture frames strewn about the room. And take multiple pictures of that scene, with varying levels of wildness and debauchery, that then get photoshopped into the many picture frames around the room."
