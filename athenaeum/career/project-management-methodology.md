# Project Management Methodology

## How do I ensure efforts stay on track?
- 2-Week Sprints
- Defining “Initiatives” - the business goal
- Defining “Epics” - a product effort that supports the Initiative
- Defining “Stories” - requirements from the user perspective of engaging with that which was defined by the epic.
- Defining “Tasks” - requirements from a technical perspective supporting the epic or a story.

### Story and Task Points

Whenever I’m leading a team, I like to let the team define their own points and then see what cadence the team has on average, as well as individuals. This then allows me to best know where I can push and adjust for productivity and throughput.

## How do I handle situations where a launch date is in jeopardy?

This depends on what is causing the delay or issue.
- Is it that a certain developer isn’t meeting their assigned deliverables and needs support?
- Is it that there was a lack of specificity in the assigned work, and unrealistic expectations were originally set?
- Is it that the was a change in scope or direction from leadership?

In certain scenarios, I’m able to reallocate resources as needed. For example, maybe that’s assigning a more senior engineer (or myself) to help someone more junior complete work they're struggling to complete.

In others, however, it’s about clearly communicating to any stakeholders all steps I have taken to ensure that everything has been done to prevent a schedule slip before sharing with them the updated project status - and then doing whatever I can to support them if there are negative repercussions.
    
In summary, my process would be:

1. **Become aware of issues** that will delay the completion of the project.
2. **Investigated the situation** and have found it to be a legitimate reason for altering the project schedule.
3. **Confirmed that no mitigation actions** can be initiated to keep the project on schedule.
4. **Alerted stakeholders** of the situation and scheduled a future meeting to seek approval on a proposed revision to the schedule. Almost certainly your schedule delays will add costs, which will be reflected in the revised plan.
5. **Evaluated options** for proceeding and made a selection of the preferred path.
6. **Completed re-planning activities** for the preferred path forward. You’ve covered the traditional project accountabilities (scope, schedule, cost) and have also included information on the impact on the business.

## Are I aware of the biggest risks I'm managing? 

**How do I mitigate the risks?**
Well, every project is exposed to risks unique to itself. In the initial planning phase of a project, I try to surface as many of those risks as possible. Some of which are important to make the team aware of, others of which are only relevant to myself as the leader and higher level stakeholders.

**Risks relevant to the team:**
- Technology risk: are the technologies we using secure, stable, dependable, open-source?
- Scope creep risk: have we collected enough information from stakeholders/customers for a complete product/project vision?
- Market risk: When a project fails to meet the stated results, market risk is likely to occur. Competitors might take the advantage to cripple the business and eliminate it from the market. Are we engaging with customers and truly addressing a need in the market? Do we have an awareness of changing market factors?

**Risks relevant to the myself and high-level stakeholders:**
- Cost risk: are we aware of the true cost of the solution (dev, talent, deploy, maintenance)?
- Skill risk: Is there an accessible pool of talent that has the skills required for the project? If we lose someone, is the project document in a way that allows new participants to be productive?
- Performance risk: Do we have systems in place to track performance, and by doing so, best mitigate the need to request additional budget, time, or other resources.
        
## Do I use data to drive design decisions?

**Steps to data driven decision making:**
1. Look at your objectives and prioritize
2. Find and present relevant data
3. Draw conclusions from that data
4. Plan your strategy
5. Measure success and repeat

Data that I use and seek out when making decisions.
- Customer Feedback / Experimentation+testing has been the primary data I’ve collected and relied on at my companies
	- Building more advanced capabilities into 8base after learning that our power users are senior engineers.

**How do I determine the effectiveness of solutions?**
- Adoption metrics and customer feedback from the target audience group
	- Matching KPI goals set for the project/product against those realized
	- This depends greatly on the product being developed

**How do you assess system quality?**
1. Define the goal of your software
- In the case of 8base, we’ve looked at developer adoption (multiple projects per developer)
2. Determine how to measure the success of your software.
- In the case of 8base Productivity & User satisfaction surveys
	- They are running into bugs and can accomplish their development needs intuitively and straightforwardly.
	- Do they prefer the developer experience over other tools and frameworks?
3. Identify what software quality metrics are important
- In the case of 8base, uptime AND internal test coverage.
4. Choose a test metric that will be easy to implement and analyze
- In case of 8base, test coverage, and uptime
5. Set up a system for collecting data on this test metric over time
- This is calculated ongoing
6. Analyze the results to identify trends in quality, if any exist at all
- As long as we’re maintaining (as a fast-moving startup) 80%+ test coverage on production code and a 99.95+ uptime, we’re in a good spot. Or at least a spot where we can not worry about the integrity of the solution and instead the value gained by users/
