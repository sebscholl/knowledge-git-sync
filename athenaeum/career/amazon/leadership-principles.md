# Amazon Leadership Principles

### Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backward. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

### Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long-term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”

### Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

### Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong business judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

### Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

### Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders continually raise the bar and drive their teams to deliver high-quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

### Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results.
They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

### Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value
calculated risk-taking.

### Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expenses.

### Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

### Earn Trust of Others
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume.They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

### Dive Deep

Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ. No task is beneath them.

### Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

### Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

This doc shows how they will challenge my answers. It also provides behavioral questions to prepare answers for.

### Main: Bias for Action

**Sub: Customer Obsession, Ownership, Are Right, A Lot**

1. **Tell me about a time when you didn't have enough data to make the right decision.** 
2. **Tell me about a strategic decision you made without clear data or (NOT AND) benchmarks.**
3. **Tell me about a time when you evaluated the customer experience of your product or service**.

1. What did you do? 
2. What path did you take? 
3. What alternatives did you consider? 
    1. Extending the 14-day Free Trial
    2. Offering discounts / “sign-up now” incentives? (Create urgency)
    3. Invest more time in the top of funnel demand (marketing problem)
    4. Spend more time and money validating that we were attracting the right audience.
4. What were the tradeoffs of each?
    1. While each alternative addresses the problem through a different lens, I felt that they were better grouped into being action-oriented vs. research-oriented. 
    2. I felt confident with the limited information I had that to move forward with taking action, and that the free-tier approach was the most customer-centric approach.
5. Did the decision turn out to be the correct one?
6. How did you mitigate risk?
    1. In this story, I really didn’t.

**S:** I had recently joined my current employer as a project manager, and the company was experiencing a terrible conversion rate on website visits to new accounts (less than 0.5%). While it wasn’t specifically my assigned area of responsibility, my team and I were indirectly being affected, as fewer people signing up meant fewer users I could tap into for building strong customer/developer relationships and gathering real product feedback, and guiding our roadmap.

**T:** So, I decided to take it upon myself to lead an effort to address this problem, which there wasn’t a clear route to gathering data on why website visitors were turned away (no way of getting in contact with those who left). Being that we were a developer tool, this was really about putting myself in our developer customers’ shoes and using my intuition on what their experience was when showing up on our website/landing pages.

**A:** I took some time to explore the different user journeys myself and found that while all the value messaging/explanations props seemed accurate, our main call to action was encouraging users to sign up for a 14-Day Free Trial. For a developer tool, this didn’t seem right, as I felt from my own experience that the decision timeline for experimenting with new development tools wasn’t that contained or efficient, plus, our competitors offered free tiers for attracting new users. Therefore, I quickly moved to authoring a document and advocating for our company to get rid of the 14-day Free Trial and implement a free use tier for developers. This wasn’t a trivial effort either, as it required me to coordinate between our finance team for financial impacts, product team for paywall changes, and marketing team for updating our messaging and analytics/funnels. However, after advocating for this with key stakeholders, I was able to lead the implemention in 6-weeks and get it done on time.

**R:** In the end, it really paid off. After the first month, we calculated a new conversion rate of roughly 3% on-site visits to new accounts. Additionally, in the following 3 months, we calculated an average conversion rate of 5% on free to paid accounts within 30-days. Not only was that a meaningfully higher conversion rate than that previously seen on 14-day free trials to paid accounts. I, and others, interpreted it as vindicating the assumption that developers require a longer experimentation period to arrive at making purchase decisions on tools.

### Main: Bias for Action

1. **We don't always make the right decision all the time. Tell me about a time when you made a bad decision**. 
2. **We don't always make the right judgment all the time. Tell me about a time when you made an error in judgment**. 
3. **Tell me about a time when you discovered that your idea was not the best course of action.** 
    1. What was the impact of that decision? 
    2. What did you learn? 
    3. How have you applied what you learned?
    4. What was the best course of action? 
    5. Who provided it? 
    6. What did you learn from the experience?
    
    **S:** Earlier on at 8base – my current employer – we were experiencing a pretty steady flow of developer support emails that myself and several developers I managed were responsible for responding to/handling; there was no system in place for managing these in-bound requests. In light of our product centric responsibilities, our email response time wasn’t exactly the best. One email in particular that a customer sent directly to our CEO about not having received any support on an important bug for over a week is what finally tipped the scales, and made us all say “we need to do something about this.”
    
    **T:** My CEO told me that we need to implement a system and policy for handling support questions and ensuring a discrete response time.
    
    **A:** Given that these support tickets often required us asking many questions to diagnose the problem/solution, they were very conversational in nature. Any support request often having on average 6 messages back and forth. Therefore, I decided that the best way for handling these conversations was to create a public Slack community in which we could have live conversations with developers, as well as other developers with each other. This also felt like a great, low cost and highly actionable way to build better relationships with our developer community.
    
    **R:** However, immediately, our customers began expecting “real-time” communication and support, which we had no systems in-place to support being a US based company with a global customer-base. None of the incoming messages were organized or prioritized, allowing many messages to fall through the cracks as they got lost in the messaging feeds. And lastly, there was significant friction directing customers to sign-up for Slack and then join our channel, when they we’re reaching out via email. All that said, in retrospect, it was just a terrible solution to the problem. 
    
    As a result, I quickly recognized that my solution wasn’t good and it’s flaws would simply amplify as we scaled. However, it did surface for me two qualities **that needed** to be in the viable solution. These were:
    
    1. 24-hour accessibility/availability (providing support while we sleep)
    2. Organization/prioritization of support queries (allowing nothing to fall through the cracks)
    
    With these in-mind, I dug in on finding the most cost effective ways of solving this issue and ended up arriving at building a support forum community on Discourse. Doing so provided a very accessible and public platform for us to handling support conversations, which other users could then benefit from learning from or participating in around the clock. It alleviated us from the expectation of “chat-like” support, which we simply didn’t have the human capital/time resources to provide.  Additionally, it allowed us to organize around the tool, and easily gather insights around engagement, response times, and other metrics.
    
    This course correction ended up being a great solution which we still rely heavily on today. An unintended benefit of which was that all these support conversations are indexed by search engines, and has led to the community being one of our primary lead generation assets.

**IF THE QUESTION IS SOLVE A PROBLEM WITH DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, GO ROUTE OF HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS (PILOTS, TEAM, INVESTORS, ETC.)**

**IF THE QUESTION IS DIFFICULT DECISION, TALK ABOUT DECIDING TO PIVOT, WHICH LOST CERTAIN EXISTING OPPORTUNITIES BUT WAS BETTER FOR THE LONG RUN.**

**S:** At the last startup I founded in 2017, RampEX, we were building a Virtual Reality role-play simulator for sales training. It was a very cool product. After about 10-months into the project, I had raised around $500k in seed capital from 6 investors, built-up a team of 4 engineers + me, and launched the first product iteration in pilot programs with two major companies, Century21 RealEstate and LinkedIn. With very little marketing I was receiving inbound interest, and our main stakeholders at the time (the investors and team), we’re all extremely proud of the product - being a working product built with cutting edge technology. That said, there was one big problem. Engagement in the pilot programs was terrible. While pilots and potential customers identified greatly with the pain and product’s perceived value, they were not engaging with the actual solution. Simply put, trainees weren’t putting on the headset.

**T:** As the Founder, it was mission critical that I not only communicate to all the stakeholders what was happening, but lean on everyone’s collective wisdom and experience in uncovering the best path forward.

**A:** I organized a series of workshops to speak with end users and managers at each pilot, my engineers, and my investors where I collected feedback (or brainstormed) on the products usability, marketability, and perceived/delivered value.

The outcome of these sessions were some extremely valuable insights that led to a fundamental shift in the company/product; or even a pivot. While all pilot participants were intrigued by/supportive of the leveraging of VR as a training tool, almost none of them we’re willing to 1) put on a shared headset for sanitary reasons, and 2) find time outside of their normal responsibilities to book time in a simulation room (where the headset was located).

These insights helped my engineering team analyze the product, and come up with the idea of moving away from VR while salvaging/refactoring our products underlying algorithms. This led the engineers suggesting that we explore a different customer interface/experience than VR, which in subsequent interactions with the pilots participants they identified as being mobile first.

This new product direction resulted in me going back to the investors for add on financing.

**R:** While it was a difficult decision, given the momentum we’d been building and our identity largely being that of a VR app, it was the right decision and an accurate solution to the problem. In 3-months we were able to abstract away the VR into a mobile first PWA that delivered the same training value, though in a more easily accessible and personal experience.

**ABOVE AND BEYOND FOR A CUSTOMER**

Taking time out of the weekend to meet with a customer and help the do role play and presentation prep for an investor meeting, involving the software we built them.

Why Amazon?

Well, 3 main reasons:

1: I look at my own life, personal and professional, and see the depth to which Amazon positively elevates it (AWS for professional, Amazon for craft/shopping/hobby, Whole Foods for eating, Kindle/Audible for education). And in no way am I alone. The level of positive impact Amazon has on my life, and those around me, I find remarkable. And it’s a organization I’d love to dedicate my passion, brain-power, and drive to.

2: I look at life as continuous education and learning. Everyday, I want to get better, smarter, and stronger. So much of that is putting yourself in environments that are challenging, dynamic, and filled with other smart people. I’ve met many people who tell me Amazon is a competitive environment; while they might have said that from a negative, I look at it as a positive. Especially when considering that Amazon hires the best, which from this interview process alone, I believe to be true. That’s the type of environment I want to work, grow, and thrive in.

3: Frankly, I’m really by, and also just the right amount nervous, by the scale of projects that I’d be able to contribute to and lead at Amazon. I’m extremely proud of the work I and the teams I’ve led have done at the startups I’ve work for. That said, the beneficiaries of that work has always been on smaller audiences. I’m super eager to take the technical and management skills I’ve developed to the next level, and can’t imagine a more formidable company to do so with than Amazon.

**Questions:**

1. In the SDM role, what opportunities are their to connect with and learn from customers? What are the rules or restrictions around doing so?
2. What have you enjoyed the most about working at Amazon?
3. I know day one is a big concept at Amazon… however, what do you know now about working at Amazon that you wish you knew either before you got hired, or as soon as you got hired?
4. What do you see SDMs face as the biggest challenges in the role? And do you see them over come these challenges, or that’s just the work?
5. FireTV is pretty established! Why is this role now available? Is the team growing? Did they loose someone? If someone left, can you share any background on why?
6. What traits make a person most successful in this role?
