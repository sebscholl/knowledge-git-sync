## SDM Role
Software Development Managers own the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of the company’s software applications, systems, and technology projects. Software Development Manager combines a system designer, people manager, roadmap/customer satisfaction driver, and project manager.

#### Interview 5

	- Software Development Manager (AWS Shield) Seattle, WA 

*The Bar Raiser has no vested interest in current role, just wants Amazon to be better)*

**QUESTIONS**

Dave
- AWS, like Amazon, leads with Customer Obsession (I imagine). However, Amazon internally is as relevant a customer as external customers. How does that relationship get managed or prioritized?
- I've been with a startup the past few years whose business exists because, put simply, AWS is hard to approach. The developer community at large has this funny love/hate relationship with AWS where they tell themselves they can just build it on AWS but then try, get into the weeds, and use a solution (like netlify or Heroku) which the justify as being on AWS but saving them time. Are these devs a priority for AWS? How does the company think about usability and approachability (which I guess would be invent and simplify). 

Wenchuan
