**Situation**
- When I got hired at my current employer, my first order of business was product documentation
	- We were essentially an undocumented developer tool.
	- Which I guess is the tech equivalent of a prohibition speakeasy
- It was the very early days of the company
	- Few developers playing with the tool
	- Many support emails ask even the simplest questions
- My first 2-months were very much spent in solitary 
	- Completely devoured the product and emerged 2-months later
	- I authored 35,000 words of developer documentation
	- Developed the documentation solution that we used till very recently today
		- Open-source
		- Docusaurus
- I launched our docs site with an analytics tool installed
	- Tracked that a number of developers were accessing docs
		- Roughly the number of users in the tool at the time
	- Had little to no impact on the number of support questions

**Task**
- I needed to find a way to further simplify the training and documentation materials to enable the developer community.

**Action**
- Reached out and got in touch with 10 active devs using the product
	- Invited them to interview on how they went about learning new tools 
- Overall, they detailed the same methodologies
	- Look for "PoC Project" (Getting Started, ToDo App, self-defined)
	- While they would reference documentation:
		- Preferred watching video content of other devs working with tools and building
- With this feedback, I did two things:
	- Created 2 Boilerplate Apps Getting Started Apps
		- React.JS + BE Asset
		- Vue.JS + BE Asset
		- Two most common frameworks Customers were developing with
	- Dusted off an old DSLR camera I had and painted my walls green
		- Branded and Kicked off 8base Academy YouTube Channel

**Result**
- I started recording and producing bi-weekly training Academy videos
	- This had a tremendously positive impact
	- Linked them to the documentation
	- Promoting our company and brand on YouTube
	- Distributed the videos via email newsletter
- That Channel has grown to 750 Subscribers
	- 65,000 views and 3000 hours of watch time
	- By far, our most engaging content and content
- While the initial product documentation is foundational to our product:
	- The YouTube channel made it tremendously simpler for developers to qualify and adopt our platform
	- Made it easier for them to gain a working knowledge of the tool and best practices
