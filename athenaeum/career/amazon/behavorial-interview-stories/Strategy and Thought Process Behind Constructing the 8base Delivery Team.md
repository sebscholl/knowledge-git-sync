**8base Product Organization Structuring**

The goal in my structuring of the 8base leadership organization is to make clear lines of responsibility between the different delivery groups. For a while, we were experiencing seriously internal issues in delivering product due to duplicated work and misalignment between delivery and design teams.

Our CEO is very design focused, from both an interface and system level. Therefore I structured the Product Design Team to include him, our CTO, lead UX/UI designer, and myself. Our responsibility and output being detailed visual and written specifications about what the products should do and how they should do it, per input collected from customers and a degree of internal product visioning. Our PM Director would partcipate, as he would be responsible for taking these assets to his Project Management Group.

The Project Management Groups responsibity and output is to translate Product Design assets to user stories and tasks, organize those in the Project Management system (JIRA) and then assign them to the approiate Project Manager + Enginnering Team. Project Managers that needed additional clarity or explanation could elevate those back to the design group, though when they felt they had a full understanding of what was being accomplished and how it benefitted our audience or system, they'd take it to the relevant team.

Engineering Teams work directly with a PM who is responsible for keeping the delivery of an Epic by a certain date. There are 3-teams that each focus on a core area of work (App Builder Backend, 8base Backend, and all Front-end).
