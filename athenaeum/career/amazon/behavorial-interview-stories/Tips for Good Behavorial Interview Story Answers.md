# Tips for Good Story Answers

1. Be clear about what parts you owned and what parts you delegated. Managers know how to effectively delegate.
2. The Customer's need **is the situation** (STAR is rolling around the customer)
3. Never end with a negative; "these were the problems, these are what we learned."
4. Embed Customer obsession is **every question.**
5. Embed data-driven thinking in **every question.**


### Questions you can't/shouldn't answer
"I don't have anything from my recent past that will relate to that question. Is there anyway you could give me another one."

"I was told to prepare my stories and notes. I don't want to miss any data points."
