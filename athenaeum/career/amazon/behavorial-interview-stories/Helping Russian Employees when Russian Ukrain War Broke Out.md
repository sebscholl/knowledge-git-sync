# Helping Russian Employees when Russian Ukrain War Broke Out

### Sub-prompts
- Why was it important? 
- What was the outcome?
- How did you balance the risk against existing business goals? 
- What was the outcome? 
- What did you learn from this situation? (Manager)

**Situation**
- Ukraine/Russian war broke out, and 75% (32) of our engineers were in St. Petersburg, RU
- Overnight, 8base's business changed 
	- Customers (professional services and platform) began contacting us:
		- Don't want their product's developed in Russia
		- Wanted assurances that Russian-based teams didn't have access to their systems
	- Additionally, whether or not our customers were supportive, payments were being closed 
- Our exec team all got together to collectively play this chess game and delegate responsibility
	- We didn't have a business continuity plan in place for such a situation
	- Mainly due to size and maturity of the company

**Task**
- They asked that I develop a plan for best helping our Russian team members
	- They were focused on quickly hiring up in our Medellin office to mitigate the operational damage

**Action**
- I immediately called the team leads in RU (Euvgeny)
	- Asked for a breakdown of what's happening on their side
		- Which team members intend to fight
		- Which team members are looking to flee
		- What team members want to keep working/leave (protect family, etc.)
	- Explained Customer's concerns with security 
		- Needed to quickly transfer project ownership over to Columbian counterparts
	- Asked for a breakdown of the economics 
		- How much money do they have for salaries?
		- What's a realistic relocation budget?
			- Where could they relocate?
			- Who had families/spouses?
- Went back to execs and proposed:
	- We wire out 3-months salaries immediately
		- Necessary to avoid project abandonment (Big risk / unsecured)
	- Tell RU employees that they have two options:
		- Stay in RU, complete work transfer in 2-weeks, take 2-month severance
		- Complete work transfer in 2-weeks, try to immigrate (i.e. Georgia)
			- Take $5k from a 2-month buffer + $1k per family member
			- Georgia is where Evgeny said was the most likely place to flee
				- If they make it...we'd re-instate their prior employment agreement
	- This was a big financial risk for us
		- I felt bigger was the risk of losing so much of our core talent
		- And the setback that would have on our Customers and their products
	- My team approved the plan

**Results**
- Overall
	- 40% completed transfer and took a severance
		- Elderly family members and other roots prevented them from moving
	- Almost 50% completed transfer and migrated
	- Several members never showed back up to work, and some that immigrated we still haven't heard from
- I took decisive action on designing and putting forth this plan
	- Russian operation shutdown entirely within 3-months
	- I maintained 15 of our 32 engineers
		- Working fully remote Georgia, Turkey, and Armenia
	- Successfully incentivized the different stakeholders in this crisis to complete the critical path items
		- Knowledge/work transfer
		- Maintaining core talent
