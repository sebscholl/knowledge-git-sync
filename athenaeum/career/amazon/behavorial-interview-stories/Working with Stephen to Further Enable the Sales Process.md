# Working with Stephen to Further Enable the Sales Process

### Sub-prompts
- One important thing when hiring anyone is seeing them being able to grow beyond the roll they're being hired for.
- How did you coach an individual in areas where you have a weakness? (Manager)
-  What problem were you trying to solve?
- How did you measure success?
- What was the end result/impact? (Manager)

**HIRING INTRO**
- We had no sales talent
	- My CEO fielded opportunities
	- He then called me the "closer" (demo and technical sale)
- We wanted to grow our professional services
	- I said there's no way this is happening without sales talen
	- Lead gen, nurturing, etc
- I was performing a Sales Engineering function in our professional services effort
	- Needing someone who would come in and own the process
- Was overall a pretty poor customer experience at that point
	- CEO was distracted with many product efforts (as was I)
	- Take me a day or two to follow up with supporting resources
	- Poor response time to customer inquiries
- I asked my CEO for budget to bring in a sales hire
	- Got approval

**Situation**
-   Stephen had been with 8base for 9-months 
	- He stood out for having strong analytical skills
	- He had strong interpersonal skills for engaging customers
	- He had a very holistic understanding of sales being a process rather than an outcome  
- He had already closed business but felt that the process could be optimized
	- He approached me with the idea of using data for due diligence/qualifying opportunities 
	- Wanted to make sure the relevant profiles were in the initial calls. 
	- To date, our customers usually went through 3 or more calls before we'd pulled in all the right players
- He asked for my help in designing a solution/process to this problem:

**Task**
- How can we use data to minimize:
	- Number of calls required to close an opportunity?
	- To do that, how can we identify more early who internally needs to be on calls?

**Action**
- I set aside time to sit down with him and learn what he'd been doing to date
	- Inbound opportunity comes in
	- Spends time finding person on LinkedIn and manually bringing data into Hubspot
	- Books 20-minute disco call (poor discovery training, one-on-one)
	- Books 30-minute call with CEO (tells founder story, CEO-Salesperson-Customer)
	- Books 1-hour call with me (perform demo, Me-Salesperson-Customer)
	- Books additional call to talk budget and project (10% conversion here, more players)
- This was terrible from a resource opimization standpoint
- We came up with an "ideal process" that we felt: 
	- Best optimized the experience for the customer
	- Best utilized the resources of the Company
- New process
	- 10-minute discovery call (intro and budget qualification)
	- 45 minute demo ONLY if technical audience
	- 45 minute scoping call, followed by proposal
- In order to put this plan into action
	- Discovered a data-enrichment tool that would automate LinkedIn profile data collection
	- Developed sussinct discovery questions for 10-minute call
	- Came up with "Customer Profile" that would be reviewed to determine who would best influence the customer (CTO? CEO? ME? etc.)
		- Consider senority and skillset

**Result**
- Data Enrichment tool had 90% hit rate
	- Saved ~10-hours per week of data entry/research
	- Reduced the number of calls required to get customers a prosal from 4+ to 2-3
	- Customer's became increadibly more engaged (not burdenint non-tech with tech)
	- In the first quarter that we implimented this new system:
		- Closed 40% more business than prior quarter
		- 75% more revenue (elastic pricing based on lead value)
	- This effort really led to significant growth for us
		- Enabled Stephen hire and manage SDR 
		- This was his first management move
