**Situation**
- About 1-year ago we began expanding our engineering team globally:
	- 24-hour engineering support to customers
	- Mitigate some global concentration risk
	- To date, engineering teams was in Saint Petersburg, RU. 
- 2 of the Russian project managers reported to me on several products:
	- CLI
	- JS-SDK
	- Cetrain Backend features
- I had relationships in Medellin, Columbia tech-scene
	- Appropriate time difference
	- Close to Miami
- Organized a trip with CEO to go set up operations
	- Office space, first team members, other resources
	- Operation set relatively quickly in Columbia.
- The Russian team needed to play a key role in enabling onboarding and training of the new team. 
	- The PM reporting to me, Ilya, was extremely dismissive of the new team members. 
- His concerns were:
	- These new engineers wouldn't be able to keep up
	- There were going to slow down the Russian engineers
	- The company should be investing in expanding the Russian operation instead

**Task**
- This contention/dynamic fell on my shoulders to resolve

**Action**
- Scheduled a call with Ilya to cover motivations:
	- Importance of 24-hour engineering support for customers
	- Needed more capacity to deliver roadmap in a timely manner
	- We're the "same team" in different time zones (not a competition)
	- Ensure we'd take the same care to pick great people in Columbia as in Russia. 
	- I appreciated him caring about high standards. 
		- Premature to make a judgment call. 
- He wasn't budging and remained pretty vocal with me about it. 
- Started experiencing a ton of issues. 
	- Velocity on story points dropped by almost 30% in Jira first month
	- Russian engineers rejecting code merges without justification
	- No one was playing nice and both sides were pointing fingers
- Set up another call with Ilya to make sense of what was happening
	- Focused on the importance of enabling new engineers to be productive 
	- **Scaling the global presence was key to scaling the business**
	- He wasn't budging. 
		- Insisted they meet the team's standards
- I decided to dive deeper to validate whether Ilya's points were more broadly felt
- I reached out directly to the Russian engineers:
	- Ilya propagated rumors that the Columbians were hired to replace Russian operations
	- This was very upsetting, though I could empathize with him feeling threatened by the shifting landscape.

> [!NOTE] Communicating Up
> - Before addressing Ilya, I communicated this backup to my CEO: - Informed me of a pre-existing compensation plan for "heads managed" - Felt I'd collected enough evidence and insight to understand dynamic

- His actions and mentality deeply concern me, and I questioned his potential to grow into higher leadership roles as the company continued to grow.
	- I communicated this back to my CEO
	- We'd agreed on giving him 3-weeks to bring the velocity back up to speed and unblock Columbian team members

**Result** 
- Unfortunately, he didn't bring it back around. 
	- At that point, the business suffered too much 
	- Columbian teams continued to report unfair treatment
	- I made the call to let him go.
- I had developed a strong relationship with the other Russian PM, Maxim
	- He agreed to step up and assume some of Ilya's core responsibilities 
	- I took on others while we identified a replacement.
	- Within 4-weeks, we were able to bring on a new PM that came in with the right mindset
- In the interim, I came up with an idea I had that helped repair a lot of animosities that had developed between the teams 
	- The Columbian and Russian programmers who spoke English (50%) were paired up for an hour each day for paired programming
	- This helped greatly build their human connection and quickly dispel the negative sentiment
