**Situation**
- As a bootstrapped company we did a lot of custom software development
	- Customer profile was most Non-technical Startup Founders
- I offered to take the lead on delivering one project in the Sales Enablement space, which I had experience in
- The architecture, roadmap, and timeline, fell on my plate.
	- I found the project interesting, so was excited about it.
- However, several months into the build we realized a fundamental issue in our core platform that needed to be addressed (performance issue on security feature)
	- The developers I had working on delivering this project were immediately needed elsewhere
	- CTO anticipated them being off project for about 4-weeks

**Task**
- I had to manage the customer relationship and communicate what was going on.
- Keep in mind:
	- Justify delay in timeline
	- Maintain confidence in underlying platform

**Action**
- I first contacted our CRO who was the highest level stakeholder in maintaining these relationships 
	- Clued her in on what's happening and asked if she had suggestions
- She suggested offering a financial incentive
	- Example: month payment pushed back
	- Personally, I didn't like that approach, as I felt that maininting the customers trust in the relationship was top priority
		- Didn't see money solving for that.
- I wrote an email to the customer, explaining that:
	- We're a Startup, like him
	- An addressable issue was discovered on our core platform which demands the attention of developers working on his team
	- We're anticipating a 4-week delay on delivery
	- I'd like to hop on an in-person call to answer any questions and talk through the situation
		- Brainstorm ways to use the extra 4-weeks to create a better product

**Result**
- He took me up on the call
	- We spent one hour talking through, in laymans terms, the issue being address and how not addressing it could impact the application being built for him
- Discussed ways that we could utilize the added time to create a better output
	- Decided that we could re-visit/re-engage designer to hold several sessions on improving UX/UI
	- Fortunately, we had not yet started front-end build
- In total, the extra design plus management only equated to about 8-additional man hours (between myself and designer)
- Engineers resolved issue in 4-week timeframe and delivered Customer's project, incorporating the improved Front-end tweaks.
