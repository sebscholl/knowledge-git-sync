**Situation**
- Our company hired our first Sales Leader
	- A really strong sales background
	- 0 tech experience
- I'd played the role of Sales Engineer for over a year
	- Confident in my ability to handle Technical aspects
	- We needed her to drive the sales process (outreach, nurture, close)
- It became clear that she was deeply uncomfortable in technical discussions
	- I was immediately concerned about the impression this gave the customer

**Task**
- I realized that the company had yet translated the technical benefits into business value
	- That needed to be done
- I felt that this Sales Leader would be significantly more confident with some basic tech-knowledge
	- I could help her

**Action**
- I reached out to her and suggested that we find a weekly time to connect
- Explained to her to: 
	- There are some fundamentals I believe she'd enjoy learning
	- A great exercise we could complete together is translating technical features into business value
- No one expected her to become technical! That's why I'm around.
	- She felt this was a great idea and took me up on the offer

**Result**
- Within a few sessions, I was able to help her get a conceptual understanding of our product
	- In no means an architect, though could articulate the *how, what,* and *why* of a BaaS
- Went feature by feature and came up with business value messaging that she felt confident in delivering
	- As hoped, this led to: 
		- Significantly better discovery calls
		- Less reliance on me in conversations
		- Laid foundation for much of the marketing inputs that were later needed
