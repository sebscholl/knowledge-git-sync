# Passthrough Pricing Model not Being Adopted or Endorsed by Team

**Situation** 
- Getting a ton of feedback from developer customers on our Pricing model
	- Felt it was confusing
	- Couldn't effectively forecast
- This kicked off an exercise for revamping our pricing model
	- Myself and several execs were involved.
- Pricing had been a bit of a contentious issue since the company's inception
	- I was excited that our customers were raising flags to address it
- Most solutions the team proposed, I felt, didn't address the core issue
	- They were tweaking quantities and quotas on limits
	- Not feedback that stemmed from the core model
- Model was subscription tiers with bundled limits + overages
	- Per customer feedback, scaled awkwardly
	- Transparency ended at $500/mo with "Talk to Sales"
- However, this was inline with what all competitors were doing

**Task**
- Based on ideas being tossed around, I looked at "a new approach" as having to come from me.

**Action**
- I came up with an approach that I felt was somewhat novel
	- Separate Design/Development tools from Cloud Resources
	- Charge flat subscription for Tool Access
	- Charge transparent margin for Cloud Resource utilization
- This provided customer with: 
	- Unmistakable clarity on "what they pay for"
	- Allowed them to forcast on utilization as opposed to "tier guessing"
- I prepared a document detailing the change
	- Linked everything back to customer interviews and feedback we'd recieved.
- I reviewed it without CRO, who was generally in support.

**Result**
- CEO and CTO rebuffed the approach
	- Felt that it didn't provide margins needed for SaaS Series A investment
	- They felt that it provided to little margin on the largest customers (avoided bespoke subscription tiers)
- Took the feedback positively
	- Recognized our a fundamental difference in mentality between the "customer we serve"
- CEO had prepared his own model, which was much more tailored to sales led growth
	- He felt more confident in his model being attractive to investors, his responsibility which I suported
	- While they weren't in support of my model, they appreciated future planning 
		- We reworked from my model a linear approach to overages
- I still believe that my model provides better transparency for our developer customers, 
	- This experience helped me understand the investor was our primary customer
- The model that got implimented didn't result in an uptick in sales. 
	- Questions recieved through our in-app chat regarding pricing dropped significantly
	- Believed can be attributed greatly to successfully updating the linear overages approach
