# Switching from 14-day Free Trial to Free Tier on 8base

**S:** I had recently joined my current employer as a project manager, and the company was experiencing a terrible conversion rate on website visits to new accounts (less than 0.5%). While it wasn’t specifically my assigned area of responsibility, my team and I were indirectly being affected, as fewer people signing up meant fewer users I could tap into for building strong customer/developer relationships and gathering real product feedback, and guiding our roadmap.

**T:** So, I decided to take it upon myself to lead an effort to address this problem, which there wasn’t a clear route to gathering data on why website visitors were turned away (no way of getting in contact with those who left). Being that we were a developer tool, this was really about putting myself in our developer customers’ shoes and using my intuition on what their experience was when showing up on our website/landing pages.

**A:** I took some time to explore the different user journeys myself and found that while all the value messaging/explanations props seemed accurate, our main call to action was encouraging users to sign up for a 14-Day Free Trial. For a developer tool, this didn’t seem right, as I felt from my own experience that the decision timeline for experimenting with new development tools wasn’t that contained or efficient, plus, our competitors offered free tiers for attracting new users. Therefore, I quickly moved to authoring a document and advocating for our company to get rid of the 14-day Free Trial and implement a free use tier for developers. This wasn’t a trivial effort either, as it required me to coordinate between our finance team for financial impacts, product team for paywall changes, and marketing team for updating our messaging and analytics/funnels. However, after advocating for this with key stakeholders, I was able to lead the implemention in 6-weeks and get it done on time.

**R:** In the end, it really paid off. After the first month, we calculated a new conversion rate of roughly 3% on-site visits to new accounts. Additionally, in the following 3 months, we calculated an average conversion rate of 5% on free to paid accounts within 30-days. Not only was that a meaningfully higher conversion rate than that previously seen on 14-day free trials to paid accounts. I, and others, interpreted it as vindicating the assumption that developers require a longer experimentation period to arrive at making purchase decisions on tools.

**What did you do?** 

**What path did you take?** 

**What alternatives did you consider?** 
    1. Extending the 14-day Free Trial
    2. Offering discounts / “sign-up now” incentives? (Create urgency)
    3. Invest more time in the top of funnel demand (marketing problem)
    4. Spend more time and money validating that we were attracting the right audience.

**What were the tradeoffs of each?**
    1. While each alternative addresses the problem through a different lens, I felt that they were better grouped into being action-oriented vs. research-oriented. 
    2. I felt confident with the limited information I had that to move forward with taking action, and that the free-tier approach was the most customer-centric approach.

**Did the decision turn out to be the correct one?**

**How did you mitigate risk?**
    1. In this story, I really didn’t.
