# Building the RampEX Team to deliver a one-of-a-kind VR Training System

### Sub-prompts
- What factors did you consider in constructing the team?
- Did you factor diversity into your team construction? 
- How did you balance work requirements, team skill composition, and team stretch opportunities? What do you consider when you allocate work?
- How did you ensure team members were able to work effectively together? 
- Would you have done anything differently? (Manager)

**Situation**
- Founded my first start-up
	- Mission was to reduce sales ramp by helping salespeople better train
	- The envisioned solution was VR-enabled role-playing simulation software
- My approach to starting the company was to develop a POC demo on my own
	- Used that + a Pitch Deck to go raise Seed funding
	- This was during the VR boom in 2016/17
- It wasn't an easy sell
	- I got rejected by dozens of investor
	- However, I pushed through and raised my target in about 4-months

**Task**
- Once I secured startup capital, it was time to build a team and get to the real work!
	- First, I needed to architect a solution to identify the required competencies
- The goal was to launch the first version of our system as a Pilots in 10 months

**Action**
- I went through my own System Design Exercise (can break down if needed)
	- Started with listing the different user personas that would be interacting with the software/system
		- Trainees, Managers, Sales Coaches, and internal admins (support) 
		- Identified that there we're 3-client applications required
			- VR App
			- 2 Web Apps (Customer facing, internal facing)
		- Single instance multi-tenant backend 
			- RoR API 
			- Python NLP Microservice 
- Broke it out into several areas of focus
	- Unity VR developer (C#)
	- Web API Developer (Ruby, AWS Cloud)
	- Web Frontend Developer (VueJS)
	- UX/UI Designer 
	- Myself (DB + Python)
- Used Upwork to identify and interview remote talent
	- Prioritized VR and backend dev hires
- I targeted my search for freelancers in Columbia, Chile, and Venezuela 
	- These countries have some of the best 
		- University of Chile
		- Universidad de la Costa
		- Universidad Simon Bolivar, Caracas
	- I wanted to find young talent with a drive to prove themselves
		- Felt fresh stem majors from these countries were that balance and a conservative budgeting decision
- I went through several dozen interviews
	- I ended up finding 2 guys I like, and they accepted my offers
- Kicked off work immediately
	- It took me another couple of weeks to nail down a UX/UI designer
		- We worked together and engaged potential customers for about 6-weeks before bringing on a front-end dev by the same means

**Result**
- I would say that those first 10 months was one of the most fun in my professional career
	- We were a close-knit crew
	- Loved working cross-functionally to solve problems together
	- Every one of them stuck around till the end, and 2 of them I brought forward into my next role (they're still there 3-years later!)
- We were able to launch an awesome technology on time
	- Completely wowed our Investors and engaged Pilot customers
	- Now, from a business standpoint...there were a lot of hard lessons to be learned
	- However, with the goal to build a team to deliver on our product vision of ourselves and investors, we hit it out of the park!
