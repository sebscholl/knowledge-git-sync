# Avoiding a Pivot to Citizen Developers for 8base

**Situation**
- 8-month into development of a new product 
	- UI-developed front-end web framework for professional developers
- It was a product that at first I was skeptical about getting behind
	- Our core product had been BaaS for Pro-devs.
	- Customer interviews I organized led me to support the project.
- CEO organized a company offsite for the core leadership team
	- Recently hired new project management director. 
- We got presented with a new vision for the product I'd architected and been managing the delivery of 
	- It targeted a completely different audience.
	- New audience citizen developers (non-technical or business people).
- I pushed our CEO and supportive team members for clarity on motivations for this new direction
	- Deeply rooted in what the new PM had delivered in past roles at low-code startups
	- Our CEO is excited by the idea of becoming a product user himself.
- I acknowledged all these points, but made the statement that this vision alienated our existing customers
	- Everyone felt professional developers (current user base) could still use the tool.

**Task**
- I'm very open to new ideas 
	- With better data - regardless of how vested I am - I'll change course.
	- But unless better data is there, I'm comfortably the black sheep
- On this one, I felt this was bad for the company for two reasons:
	- It didn't consider our existing customers that anticipated the release of the product.
	- Splitting sparse resources to attract an entirely new audience segment was a substantial risk.
	- The inspiration wasn't rooted in an identifiable customer's need (just anecdotal).

**Action**
- I dug my heels in on this one:
	- Asked that I be allowed to front-run the concept by our existing customers
		- Validate the direction.
- My concerns were that the new vision lacked flexibility and the concepts expected by professional developers. 
	- I needed to get validation on the idea for myself and the execs
	- Wanted that validation to be our current customer's voice.
- I got to work organizing 20-minute calls with existing customers 
	- Scheduled 16 different calls
	- Led through a pro and con exercise of the competing product visions 
- Focused on non-bias/leading questions:
	- I NEVER want to validate my opinion; I want to validate my assumption
	- "How might you leverage this in your professional development work?"
- Took me about a couple of weeks to complete these calls
	- Meanwhile, other execs had broken silence and attempted to gain internal support from devs. Some of whom I managed
		- Some were getting a little unnerved and confused by this, calling it a pivot.
		- I assured them everything would be fine and to sit tight.

**Result**
- Call recordings available to all the stakeholders at my company
- I consolidated the data collected into a short summary and published it. 
- Only 1 customer viewed the new product vision as something they could use in a professional capacity, though had other tools currently serving that purpose.
- 90% articulated it being counter to the value propositions that originally attracted them to our solutions
	- Didn't speak to them as professional developers
- This exercise was sufficient in bringing everyone back to our core focus of serving professional software developers
	- Explained that while the new vision is valid (there's a market) it's not our customer
	- Due to the level of leadership, I framed the conversation around "changing company direction" as opposed to "product direction."
	- This helped ground the conversation and led to the key stakeholders falling back in line on focusing on further serving our core customer base
