# Paying for Jorge's Web Dev Education During Pivot

### Sub-prompts
- How did you help that team member? 
- What was the result?
- What did you invest in and why? 
- What was the outcome? 
- Can you share an example where investing in an employee's development didn't work out?
- Can you give me an example of a specific team member and how you helped them develop across the geographic distance? (Manager)

**Situation**
- It was 10/12 months into my startup RampEX
	- VR-enabled role-play simulation training for salespeople
	- Pilot Programs gave us compelling evidence/data that VR headsets were preventing adoption
		- Un-sanitary, no "booking system", hard to "get to app"
- I'd determined that we needed to make a big change
	- Going web first
	- Customer feedback (pilots) confirmed that they were interested in the tech/but hardware was an issued
- One of our core Engineers I had was Jorge
	- Remote Venezuelan engineer whose contribution had been massive to the company
	- His competency was in Unity (VR) development and 3D animation
- The company was pivoting away from all VR
	- We were very tight on budget
	- But I didn't want to lose him as a talent

**Task**
- What can I do to maintain this person while navigating this transition?

**Action**
- I started constructing our development roadmap and timeline
	- The other engineers (including myself) were mostly backend
		- Jorge - Animation and Unity Engineer (C#)
		- Pedro - Web and API Developer
		- Me - data modeling and natural language processing
		- Alec - Frontend web developer
		- Sarah - UX / UI
- Structure the roadmap so that the first 8 weeks had no frontend
	- All the work considered there was migrating to microservices (getting out of VR)
- With this buffer, I approached Jorge
	- Explained to him the situation
	- Offered to pay for a top-tier online Bootcamp + 20% of his current salary
	- If he finishes the course in 10 weeks, re-hire him in a web-dev role 
- I had full confidence in him being able to transfer 

**Result**
- He took me up on the offer
	- I led the two other team members to successfully abstract
		- Dialog Engine
		- New Authentication
		- UX/UI Design
		- Speech-2-text / Text-2-speech
	- in 8 weeks
- Jorge knocked the curriculum out of the park
	- Came back on board 10 weeks later 
	- Continued to be a key contributor on the project
- Sad but happy
	- Few months after I had closed operations fully
	- Jorge working full time in WEB VR dev role (LittleStar)
