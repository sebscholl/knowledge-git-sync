# Getting Behind App Builder as Opposed to Backend Focus

### Sub-prompts
- What was it and how did you help your team try to achieve it? 
- Were you successful in the end? 
- Looking back, would you have done anything differently?
- How did you gain buy-in and drive execution? 
- What was the outcome? 
- Would you have done anything differently? (Manager)

**Situation**
- Pre-covid, 8base product was a backend-as-a-service product being used by roughly 200 developers
	- The product wasn't perfect but delivered great value.
- Our CEO was frustrated that we weren't growing fast enough
	- Developer adoption and subscriptions
- I was the person closest to both product and our customers
	- My analysis was that we had a strong foundation but lacked refinement in alternative solutions (Firebase, AppSync)
- We had a lot of work to do to deliver on improving the core product
	- Great edge on usability, maintainability, ease of use

**Task**
- That said, CEO and CTO decided that the best strategy for growth was "full-stack" instead of improving our existing solution.

**Action**
- I felt strongly that it distracted our core competencies and focus; backend.
	- No customers had expressed any interest in procuring full-stack technologies from us. 
	- Had favorite front-end technologies and built with decoupled architecture
- The team was adamant about "full-stack" 
	- Saw it as helping sales and marketing efforts with business people who tended to be more visual
	- A challenge we faced often when demoing and selling the backend solution
- I went out and spoke with larger customers that were digital agencies building software professionally with our platform. (Buildr, Trade, ITWoks, AscendeWare)
	- Our agency channel was an initiative I spearheaded and concepted
		- I had close relationships with these folks.
- They'd been exploring new front-end technologies 
	- Cared mostly about reducing delivery time on client projects.
- They explored several drag-and-drop tools (Bubble, Webflow, Adalo...)
	- Didn't like full-stack dependency and other limitations (coupling).
- This got my gears turning:
	- Which eventually turned out the idea of:
		- Expressed to them the idea of decoupled low-code Javascript framework
			- Separate front-end and backend for "Full tech-stack on our platform"
				- Focus on convention over configuration, framework over solution
			- We're really open to this idea and excited about it

**Results**
- The full-stack ship had set sail, so I thought I might as well help steer it.
- Wrote up an opinion on the direction
	- I reframed for our execs "Full-stack vs. Full Tech-stack" 
	- Ability to adopt our platform as their full tech stack, while also maintaining flexibility and independence between the delivered toolsets/services
- They were receptive to this framing and adopted it as the core architectural principle in our product expansion effort
	- I made a case for myself being the architect of the system, 
	- I felt I was the only one who deeply knew our customer's needs
		- Ease of use
		- Flexibility
		- Maintainability. 
- They let me take ownership of the product direction, which evolved into a frontend Javascript framework managed through a low-code UI.
	- We launched in beta earlier this year, and so far have had dozens of developers who turned away from anything deemed "low-code" acknowledge and understand the power of the system/tool.
- Were it up to me, I to this day would have stayed focused on the backend.
