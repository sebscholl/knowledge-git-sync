**IF THE QUESTION IS SOLVE A PROBLEM WITH DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, GO ROUTE OF HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS (PILOTS, TEAM, INVESTORS, ETC.)**

**IF THE QUESTION IS DIFFICULT DECISION, TALK ABOUT DECIDING TO PIVOT, WHICH LOST CERTAIN EXISTING OPPORTUNITIES BUT WAS BETTER FOR THE LONG RUN.**

**Situation:** 
- Founded in 2017, RampEX
	- Building a Virtual Reality role-play simulator for sales training. 
- 10-months into the project:
	- I had raised around $500k in seed capital from 6 investors
	- Built-up a team of 4 engineers + me
	- Launched the first product iteration in pilot programs with two major companies, Century21 RealEstate and LinkedIn Chicago. 
- Very little marketing I was receiving inbound interest: 
	- Main stakeholders at the time (the investors and team) all extremely proud of the product - being a working product built with cutting-edge technology. 
- One big problem:
	- We'd focused a lot on the product and a little on the customer
	- Engagement in the pilot programs was terrible. 
- Customers identified greatly with the pain and product’s perceived value
	- Not engaging with the actual solution. 
	- Simply put, trainees weren’t putting on the headset.

**Task** 
- Mission critical that I communicate to all the stakeholders what was happening
- Needed everyone’s collective wisdom and experience in uncovering the best path forward.
*BAD FEEDBACK: We don't like your product. Dirty, awkward, uncomfortable.*

**Action** 
- Organized workshops: 
	- End users and managers at each pilot, salespeople
- The outcome of user sessions were some extremely valuable
	- While all pilot participants were intrigued by/supportive VR as a training tool,
	- None of them we’re willing to: 
		1) Put on a shared headset for sanitary reasons
		2) Find time outside normal responsibilities to book time in a simulation room (where the headset was located).
- These insights helped my engineering team and me analyze the product from the user perspective
	- Customers had indicated that they were comfortable and familiar engaging with training content on mobile or web 
	- Idea to move away from VR while salvaging/refactoring our products underlying algorithms. 
		- I led the team through exercises of re-architecting our solution through a web interface
- We had about 6-months of cash left at the current burn
	- I need to keep my team motivated but not scare them...
	- I took a very collaborative approach to build out the timeline with them
		- Prioritized speed, started with timeline buy-in
	- Together, we determined: 
		- Having a working PoC in 60-days
		- Full enablement in 90-days

**OPTIONAL DETAIL**
- Went back to investors to explain the situation and lessons learned
	- Detailed cash position and secured commitment for an additional $100,000 (additional 4 months) of capital 

**Results** 
- It was a difficult decision
	- Momentum we’d built and our identity largely being that of a VR app, 
- It was the right decision and an accurate solution to the problem. 
	- In 3-months, the team and I abstract away the VR into a PWA 
		- Develop a number of microservices out of the systems we'd developed
		- Delivered the same training value, though in a more easily accessible and personal experience for the customer.
	- This boosted engagement in the Pilots drastically
		- Key KPI I was tracking was "avg. time training (minutes) / participant"
			- Century21 group with VR was 24-minutes first 2 weeks
			- Century21 group with Web was 97-minutes first 2 weeks
