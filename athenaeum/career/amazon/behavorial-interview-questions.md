**IF THE QUESTION IS SOLVE A PROBLEM WITH DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, GO ROUTE OF HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS (PILOTS, TEAM, INVESTORS, ETC.)**

**IF THE QUESTION IS DIFFICULT DECISION, TALK ABOUT DECIDING TO PIVOT, WHICH LOST CERTAIN EXISTING OPPORTUNITIES BUT WAS BETTER FOR THE LONG RUN.**

**S:** At the last startup I founded in 2017, RampEX, we were building a Virtual Reality role-play simulator for sales training. It was a very cool product. After about 10-months into the project, I had raised around $500k in seed capital from 6 investors, built-up a team of 4 engineers + me, and launched the first product iteration in pilot programs with two major companies, Century21 RealEstate and LinkedIn. With very little marketing I was receiving inbound interest, and our main stakeholders at the time (the investors and team), we’re all extremely proud of the product - being a working product built with cutting edge technology. That said, there was one big problem. Engagement in the pilot programs was terrible. While pilots and potential customers identified greatly with the pain and product’s perceived value, they were not engaging with the actual solution. Simply put, trainees weren’t putting on the headset.

**T:** As the Founder, it was mission critical that I not only communicate to all the stakeholders what was happening, but lean on everyone’s collective wisdom and experience in uncovering the best path forward.

**A:** I organized a series of workshops to speak with end users and managers at each pilot, my engineers, and my investors where I collected feedback (or brainstormed) on the products usability, marketability, and perceived/delivered value.

The outcome of these sessions were some extremely valuable insights that led to a fundamental shift in the company/product; or even a pivot. While all pilot participants were intrigued by/supportive of the leveraging of VR as a training tool, almost none of them we’re willing to 1) put on a shared headset for sanitary reasons, and 2) find time outside of their normal responsibilities to book time in a simulation room (where the headset was located).

These insights helped my engineering team analyze the product, and come up with the idea of moving away from VR while salvaging/refactoring our products underlying algorithms. This led the engineers suggesting that we explore a different customer interface/experience than VR, which in subsequent interactions with the pilots participants they identified as being mobile first.

This new product direction resulted in me going back to the investors for add on financing.

**R:** While it was a difficult decision, given the momentum we’d been building and our identity largely being that of a VR app, it was the right decision and an accurate solution to the problem. In 3-months we were able to abstract away the VR into a mobile first PWA that delivered the same training value, though in a more easily accessible and personal experience.

Why Amazon?

Well, 3 main reasons:

1: I look at my own life, personal and professional, and see the depth to which Amazon positively elevates it (AWS for professional, Amazon for craft/shopping/hobby, Whole Foods for eating, Kindle/Audible for education). And in no way am I alone. The level of positive impact Amazon has on my life, and those around me, I find remarkable. And it’s a organization I’d love to dedicate my passion, brain-power, and drive to.

2: I look at life as continuous education and learning. Everyday, I want to get better, smarter, and stronger. So much of that is putting yourself in environments that are challenging, dynamic, and filled with other smart people. I’ve met many people who tell me Amazon is a competitive environment; while they might have said that from a negative, I look at it as a positive. Especially when considering that Amazon hires the best, which from this interview process alone, I believe to be true. That’s the type of environment I want to work, grow, and thrive in.

3: Frankly, I’m really by, and also just the right amount nervous, by the scale of projects that I’d be able to contribute to and lead at Amazon. I’m extremely proud of the work I and the teams I’ve led have done at the startups I’ve work for. That said, the beneficiaries of that work has always been on smaller audiences. I’m super eager to take the technical and management skills I’ve developed to the next level, and can’t imagine a more formidable company to do so with than Amazon.

**Questions:**

1. In the SDM role, what opportunities are their to connect with and learn from customers? What are the rules or restrictions around doing so?
2. What have you enjoyed the most about working at Amazon?
3. I know day one is a big concept at Amazon… however, what do you know now about working at Amazon that you wish you knew either before you got hired, or as soon as you got hired?
4. What do you see SDMs face as the biggest challenges in the role? And do you see them over come these challenges, or that’s just the work?
5. FireTV is pretty established! Why is this role now available? Is the team growing? Did they loose someone? If someone left, can you share any background on why?
6. What traits make a person most successful in this role?
