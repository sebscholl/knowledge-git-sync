## Methodology for Metric Questions
[[GAME metrics framework]]



## Design Thinking
This category is about demonstrating user empathy, product visioning, and design sensibilities. Try mentioning tradeoffs of approaches.

**Questions**
- How would you improve new merchant sign-ups?
- If you were to build the next tool to help our merchants succeed, what woud it be?
- How will you design better support for friendly returns processes to ultimately make merchants more successful?

## Technical
Show you're technical. Over-index on understanding software and system design.

**Questions**
- What data points would you use to define a product recommendation engine?
- What are some concerns with ingesting data from a 3rd party source?

## Team Work
Show that you can work cross-functionally and on a team.

**Questions**
- What would you do if you and another PM had string opposing opinions?
- How do you work with developers and designers?

You can use stories to respond to these answers. Just like in your Amazon interviews. However, instead of highlighting the leadership principles, Shopify is indexing for:

1. Impact - do you leave a big impact on others around you?
2. Trust - can you communicate?
3. Engagement - do you invest in work and life?
4. Self-awareness - do I know my strength and weaknesses?
5. Readiness - are you qualified?

## PM Prep - Product Review

-   Since I interview for [product management](https://howigotjob.com/product-manager/product-management-is-a-mile-wide-foot-deep-sort-of-job-says-jack-moore-sharing-his-product-management-journey/) positions, I first go through the products of the company I am interviewing at. This gives me an idea of what the strengths and shortcomings of the product. I then make a list of improvements, enhancements or new features which would showcase my skills to the interviewers.
-   I try and learn at work every single day so that when it comes to interviewing for a position, I am already prepared and don’t have to do anything special. This is especially useful because interviewers can sense if the candidate is genuinely knowledgeable.
-   As far as possible, I read about the company, its culture and new things they are doing.


**Focus on PROBLEMS as a PM, not SOLUTIONS **
**Show that you can represent multiple points of view**
**PEOPLE are IMPORTANT when delivering product**
**DON'T MEASURE EFFORT as a key indicator, MEASURE VALUE**

### Shopify Pain Points from My Perspective
- ShopifyQL needs some TLC. It's weird to be submitting a SQL-like query as the argument to a GraphQL query and then using abstracted response types to receive data.

## BIG IDEAS
- Shopify helps with manufacturing and sourcing (Expanding MANAGE)
	- Platform for merchants to split/co-inhabit containers?
	- Bulk buying of products
	- Bring manufacturers into the ecosystem with more transparent ratings and processes?
	- Maker School
		- Manufacturing 101, Builder Guider, Maker Guides
- Use Handshake to compete with Pinterest on inspiration and curating product experiences
- Double down on tooling for modern JS and Mobile frameworks as opposed to Liquid (Hydrogen)
	- Love the unity SDK! 
- If Shopify builds tooling and SDKs for crypto payments, they could become an eCommerce backend for emerging metaverses.
- Aquire KatanaMRP (Get total visibility and control over your in-house and outsourced production with manufacturing ERP software thousands of manufacturers love)

"*While Shopify helps "merchants" sell online, I see the ecosystem of Shopify store owners being much more than merchants. Often, they are the Dreamer, Designer, Maker, and Merchant behind their company/brand. I think I see Shopify having an opportunity to look more holistically at this and create more value vertically for businesses that choose Shopify.*" 

"The truth is that not all businesses are high-value businesses. For this reason, they need to be extra prudent in obtaining high-value talent, which will sink their ship. However, when in a high-value business, it's crucial to not only obtain high-value talent but then look critically at whether that team is creating more business value than they are consuming. This is NOT mean quantifying their output or effort, but instead their impact. 

The product owner (product manager) needs the customer's feedback in the development cycle to validate feedback and steer development effort (test markets, focus groups, CABs customer advisory boards)."

**There's one way to test the value of a product. Sell it. The only way to know value is to determine what someone will pay for it.**

**4 Ways a Product can be Valuable to a Business**
-> Increase sales
-> Decrease cost
-> Decrease risk (If a quantifiable risk impacts sales/cost and removing it helps)
-> Improve opportunity (Changes that lead to increased opportunities)

## Scrum Method

Scrum is about allocating responsibility for decisions to those responsible AND CAPABLE of making those decisions. 

A great Scrum team - or well-formed team - can produce the product contained within itself. Otherwise, they have the excuse of external dependencies, which makes it an invalid team. **This doesn't mean a Scrum team should not interface with stakeholders outside the team.** It only means that the team should be cross-functional to represent to a respectable degree all stakeholders that should be considered in delivering their project.

*"Self-contained, cross-functional teams."*

*"Teams need to be taught how to say no. Otherwise, it means nothing when they say yes."*

**Principles**
- Someone granted responsibility must have the capability to deliver.
- Teams must make decisions on how to deliver their delegated responsibility.
-
