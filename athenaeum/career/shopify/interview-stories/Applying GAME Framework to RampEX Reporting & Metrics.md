# Applying GAME Framework to RampEX Reporting & Metrics

**Goal**
- There were two main customer goals I set out on when founding RampEX
	- Help a salesperson (Trainee) decrease their ramp 
		- Earn money faster
		- Feel more confident sooner
	- Help a business person (Manager) ensure consistency and efficacy of investment in training
		- Meaningful reporting and insights into training
		- Charting learning curves

Not only would this make businesses more profitable, but also drastically impact the ability of a business to:
- Identify struggling salespeople sooner and take data-driven actions early
- Improve their customer experience by ensuring consistent training (practice)

**Actions**
- This was an early startup, so my main focuses were on **Customer Acquisition** (paid pilots) and **Revenue**, though **Product engagement** is what would determine the success of my solution.
	- We were not an easy product to buy...
		- Hardware, software, only relevant to larger teams (training content), difficult onboarding
	- Land on-site through search OR interact with ad
	- Book and attend a product demo (usually several meetings)
	- Sign a pilot agreement
	- Receive credentials and set up billing
	- Receive hardware
	- Install and set up
	- Complete training and onboarding
	- Access room and simulations
	- Rinse and repeat with frequency (recommended 3 x 20-minutes per week)
- Now, if ALL these actions were completed, the user would see results fast. However, that is a lot of steps!
- Once they got into the product, though, actions were more interesting
	- Someone prepares for a customer presentation by conducting a virtual presentation
	- A salesperson conducts simulated cold calls to practice their script
	- A manager reviews a training report and leaves feedback
	- A manager updates a threshold for performance benchmarks
	- A manager adds a new-hire to the system
- There we a ton of interactions that happened across the system that was insightful to the user's engagement with the system components
	

**Metrics**
- There were some main things that I cared about, as trying to measure conversions at each of these steps – while possible – was largely noise.
	- 1. Most of the acquisition metrics are largely sales related. I'm happy to talk to them, though can focus on the product centric metrics instead?
		- Booked Demos/per month
		- Monthly Recurring Revenue
		- 
		- If demos weren't getting booked, either
	- There were a few Top Level metrics I kept my finger on the pulse of:
		- Homepage/Landing Pages Conversions
			- Avg 6% "Speak with us" CTA conversion
			- ~45% booked-meeting to demo conversion 
			- I was doing social marketing on LinkedIn to drive top of the funnel
