# What's my favorite product and how would I improve it?

### Intro
- First I'll take a minute to cover the product and what I love about it
- Then I'll cover way's in which I think it can be improved
	- Does that work?

### Jasper.ai
- For the past 6-months, I've continued to fall ever deeper in love with Jasper.ai
	- It's a web-based document editor that generates copy using AI GPT-3 behind the scenes.
	- You can work with Jasper to generate anything from Google Ad copy, Blog posts, Product documentation, and even video scripts.
	- It's an incredible tool for helping people that need to write copy either 10x their output or recover 90% of their time!
- You can think of it as an AI that's embedded in a WYSIWYG text editor that's can help you, at any point, come up with the next 50 or so words
	- Destroys writer's block
- Now, why do I love this so much? Couple reasons
	- One of my product delineators is jet_packs vs. crutches
		- Are you creating a jet_pack for people who can?
		- Or a crutch for people who can't?
		- Anyone using Jasper.ai CAN write, yet Jasper is 10x their ability to write more
		- It's a jet_pack, and I love jet_packs
	- Leveraging state-of-the-art technologies in a way that doesn't burden the user is an art that Jasper.ai handles beautifully
		- Behind the scenes, you have extremely sophisticated natural language processing models running
		- Many of them require unique parameters and configurations that many products DO burden the user with learning and leveraging
			- Dialog flow did this terribly from Google for building chat flows.
		- Jasper instead is a beautiful facade in front of all that, just letting you write as you would write, with a human-like assistant by your side.
		- I'd feel confident training my Grandmother to use Jasper.ai with ease.
	- The amount of OUTPUT demanded from companies and individuals these days (from content to emails) is crippling. 
		- I value time more than anything
		- Jasper.ai lets you take back your calendar from content demands while still producing high-quality content
		- I find that both admirable and incredibly valuable

**Now, how would I improve it? (TAKE TIME IF NEEDED)**

**Layout competitive landscape (direct and indirect)**
	- **Copysmith** focuses on large marketing teams and eCommerce.
		- Has Shopify integration
	- **Copy AI, Anyword, Writesonic**
	- It's a pretty crowded space with and fairly low barrier to entry
		- All products a (seemingly) based on GPT-3 NLP models, making differentiation opportunities mainly on UX and vertical specialization
	- Indirectly, they have a lot more competition, but I'd mainly associate it with the services industry (professionals doing this work)
		- Yet, even these would be potential users

**What are their goals?**
	- Based on their marketing copy and user forums
		- They are taking their competition head-on in trying to be the peoples choice for content marketing professionals/freelancers
	- I discovered them through an Instagram Ad as a PM, so they're doing direct response marketing to non-content professionals
		- They're exploring moving upstream to businesses through a Sales effort
		- Though mainly focused on PLG and upselling users to a power user tier
	- All that considered, it seems that they're leaning into user acquisition and monetization currently 

**Customer segments?**
- Primary customer segment is individual content writers
- While many people are using Jasper.ai professionally, it seems they've not fully catalyzed their business/enterprise customer segment.

**How would I improve it?**
- Before I mention how I'd improve it, I'd like to highlight the pain-point experienced (many tools do)
	- Jasper's text & document editor is not a value add. It's a pain-point
	- I already have a document and text editors I love and rely on (some for personal and some for professional)
	- The last thing I need, or want to be forced to use, is another one that removes me from my productive workflows
- The product Grammarly did this beautifully. 
	- Instead of telling everyone, "come write your emails and documents in our system."
	- They focused on bringing their value to the playing fields where a user needed it most (Gmail, GDocs, Chrome Browsers, etc.)
		- They have a document editor, but it's a secondary option, NOT a requirement.
- Were I at Jasper.ai, I'd improve the product by taking inspiration from Grammarly.
	- Make Jasper.ai available in the fields of play where users currently experience the pain-point
	- That could be accomplished via a Desktop App, Browser Extension, or Direct Integration (GDoc or Gmail, for example).

**How would I measure it?**
- Fortunately, something like this is pretty easily quantifiable and/or measurable
	- Jasper.ai currently tracks/bills against words generated (like a plan would have 50,000/words per month)
- As a north star metric for this feature, I'd probably establish a ratio of:
	- `words_generated_outside_jasper:words_generated_inside_jasper 7-days running`
		- This would paint a clear picture of the adoption and usage of the feature in comparison to leveraging Jasper through the embedded document editor.
		- I would then dive deeper and segment the `words_generated_outside_jasper` by client type and interface
			- GDoc? Email? Notion? Obsidian? Other
			- This would help me understand or detect usage patterns in user groups to determine whether their specific platforms enhance support.
		- Lastly, I would also keep an eye on avg. words generated
