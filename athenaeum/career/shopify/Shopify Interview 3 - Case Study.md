# Case Study**  
  
You’ll be presented with a short exercise and asked to use a digital whiteboard to work through how you would develop a product in response. The interviewer will be interested in the solution that you come up with, but also how you get there. How do you test your assumptions? How do you define your goals? They’ll ask you questions as you go and you can ask them questions too. This is a separate interview from the Mini Case Study you completed as the initial step in the interview process.

### Steps
1.  **Evaluate the need** 
	1. How did the company come up with this feature?
	2. Was it suggested by executives or by customers?
	3. Is the goal of this feature to drive revenue or increase loyalty?
	4. Are we assuming that leadership has already signed on board to this feature?
	5. Or are we assuming that this is just a small product that we have been given to test?
2.  **Validate the need** 
	1. What are your assumptions, knowns and unknowns, and where is the data? 
	2. Do we have data on this, and is the data right? 
	3. On free returns, do we know how many people already trying to return?
	4. Are there specific types of products that we know customers return? 
	5. Are there some parts of the world where customers expect free returns? Do we have data on that? (The company isn’t necessarily know that from the data because customers might not provide that feedback.)
	6. What do we _not_ know?
3.  **Set a goal for the feature**
	1. [[GAME metrics framework]]
4.  **Decision making**
- **“Yes, I want to prioritize this feature":**
	-   The manager has signed off on the strategy**.**
	-   I know who the customers are.
	-   I have the data to back it up.
	-   I have the stakeholder consensus to do it.
	-   I have a timeline that I feel confident executing on.
- **“No"**
	-   No, I don’t have a clear strategy from management.
	-   No, the manager wants me to validate this before we spend extra resources on it.
	-   No, we don’t have enough engineers or resources for this.
	-   No, we have to use the sales cycle for another feature — if we try to implement this now, we will lose the seasonal sales cycle.

## Questions:
- You've been at Shopify for six years! If you had to attribute one thing to the company keeping you there, what would it be?
- Stalked your Twitter and saw something about you building and deploying a Shopify app. What are your favorite languages and frameworks? Do you get to keep your programming skills sharp on the job, or only through extracurricular?
- Shopify Functions is exciting. Why are they contained to Discounting logic inside of Checkout as opposed to being more general purpose?
- Have any good book recommendations?
- As a TPM at D2L, any interesting insights on the Learning space? (Learning vs. practice and RampEX)
- How did you like Flow? Low code?
