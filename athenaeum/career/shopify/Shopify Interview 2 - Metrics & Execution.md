# Metrics & Execution

You’ll be asked a series of questions about how you define and set metrics to measure the performance of a product you and your team are building, and how to track impact of the product once it is shipped. In preparation for this interview, think about how you approach establishing metrics that are measurable, weigh pros and cons of certain trade-offs, and how to manage metrics that intersect and have interfered with the success or impact of a product you have shipped.

### Helpful Reminders
**4 Ways a Product can be Valuable to a Business**
1. Increase sales
2. Decrease cost
3. Decrease risk (If a quantifiable risk impacts sales/cost and removing it helps)
4. Improve opportunity (Changes that lead to increased opportunities)

"There's one way to test the value of a product. Sell it. The only way to know value is to determine what someone will pay for it."
