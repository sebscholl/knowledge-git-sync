Creating subserver processes that are exposed to public uri

Create new daemon:

daemon = Pyro4.Daemon()

Kill daemon:

daemon.shutdown()

Register object class as Instance: !Returns URI

daemon.register(MODEL/CLASS)

Get location string:

daemon.locationStr

Goes in a loop to service incoming requests, until someone breaks this or calls shutdown from another thread:

**`daemon.requestLoop`**(*loopCondition=<function Daemon.<lambda>>*)

Core Daemon class documentation:Â [https://pythonhosted.org/Pyro4/api/core.html#Pyro4.core.Daemon](https://pythonhosted.org/Pyro4/api/core.html#Pyro4.core.Daemon)

Intent:

User starts new call that generates unique ID

Unique ID is past to server

Server looks for Daemon running process with identifier unique ID

If no Daemon is found, new Daemon is initialized mounting chatbot instance trained with relevant conversation.

When new Damon is initialized, it is given time out function of one minute.

If Daemon is found, message sent along with unique ID is past to get response method proxeed to Daemon instance.

Returned value is passed back along with unique ID to the client as a Json response.
