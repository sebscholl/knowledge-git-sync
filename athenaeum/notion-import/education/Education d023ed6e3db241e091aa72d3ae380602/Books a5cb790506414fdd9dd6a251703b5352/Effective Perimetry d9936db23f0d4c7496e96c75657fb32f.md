# Effective Perimetry

Chapter 1:

Potential uses or perimetry test include:

- glaucoma diagnosis and management
- certain neurological diseases
    - inexpensive and noninvasive alternative to neuroimaging and a way of documenting changes in visual function.
- retinal diseases
- Driving readiness

Localized relative scotomas (i.e., small areas of decreased sensitivity)

Perimetric testing of glaucoma patients is seldom done in the area outside the central 30° field.

Field tests are useful when done repeatedly over time to show sensitivity loss.

Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm (SITA) Standard thresholding + 24-2 + Size III is the basic threshold test. Nail this first.

The 24-2 pattern tests 54 locations and is identical to the 30-2 pattern except that most of the outermost ring of points has been removed

The SITA Standard strategy offers high accuracy and relatively short test times of 3 to 7 minutes per eye. SITA Fast is a very fast threshold test that usually takes 2 to 5 minutes per eye and offers slightly less, but still high, accuracy, especially in experienced patients.

In advanced glaucoma, it may be helpful to concentrate testing in the remaining central field by shifting to the 10-2 pattern (Fig 4-4A–B), or to change to a larger size V stimulus (Fig 4-4C–D).

Humphry uses STATPAC Analyses to do reporting, of which it runs multiple different models.

The Pattern Deviation probability plot may be the single most useful STATPAC analysis when glaucoma is suspected.

Chapter 2:

Make sure the patient knows that they can pause the test if they need to, by holding the response
button down!

Gold-mann Size III stimulus is a stimulus that is **0.43 degrees wide (circular) in the patient's visual field**. Size V is sometimes employed in advanced field loss, while the Sizes I, II, and IV are almost
never used in static visual field testing.

(Sizes I through V subtending 0.1°, 0.21°, 0.43°, 0.86°, and 1.72°, respectively)

Instructions:

1. This test will measure the central and side vision of each eye individually. During the test, always look straight ahead at the steady yellow light.
    
    Graphic: Point to yellow fixation light.
    
2. Other lights will flash one at a time off to the side. Press the button whenever you see one of these lights.
    
    Action: Give patient the response button.
    
3. The test is designed so that it will dim the light flashes until you no longer can see them. Thus, you are not expected to see all the lights, and in fact you probably will see fewer than half of them. This also means that many of the lights you do see will be barely visible.
    
    Context: Explain procedure to
    patient.
    
4. If you want to pause the test, hold down on the button. The test will resume when you release the button.
    
    Graphic: Show hold will pause exam. Demonstrate to patient.
    
5. Testing time varies, but typically takes 5 minutes or more. You can blink normally. When your test is over, you will hear two beeps. You may then sit back and rest.
    
    Explain procedure to patient.
    

Right eye usually is tested first.

Demonstration mode that should be used before starting the “real” part of test in patients who are not yet experienced test takers. The demo test runs for 1 minute unless the perimetrist presses the Start Test button.

Is the patient looking straight ahead at the fixation light?

The normal field of vision extends more than 90° temporally, 60° nasally and superiorly, and about 70° inferiorly, but most diagnostic visual field testing concentrates on the area within 30° of fixation, where most retinal ganglion cells are located. Visual

The height or sensitivity of the normal hill of vision is affected by age, the general level of ambient light, stimulus size, and stimulus duration.

Field defect is any statistically significant depression of sensitivity compared to the normal hill of vision.

Localized field defects can be described in terms of both size and depth, and quantification of such defects is diagnostically helpful.

Light sensitivity is commonly defined as the minimum perceivable brightness, the term “threshold sensitivity” usually is used.

Stimulus Size and Intensity
The Humphrey perimeter presents white light stimuli that can be varied in brightness over a range of 5.1 log units (51 decibels [dB]) between 0.08 and 10,000 apostilbs (asb). The decibel (dB) value refers to stimulus intensity, with 0 dB corresponding to the maximum brightness that the perimeter can produce (10,000 asb) and 51 dB corresponding to 0.08 asb (Fig 3-3). In standardized testing with a Size III white stimulus, the dimmest stimulus that can be seen by a young, well-trained observer is a little less than 40 dB. Thus, the upper (and dimmest) 10 dB of the stimulus range-from 41 to 51 dB—really fall outside the range of human vision under standard testing conditions.

The physiological blind spot, which normally measures approximately 5° horizontally by 7° vertically.

Background Illumination
Stimuli are projected onto a surface that itself is uniformly illuminated at a brightness of 10 Cd/m2 (31.5 apostilbs). This adaptation level was chosen because it approximates the minimum brightness for photopic, or daylight, vision — vision that depends upon retinal cone function rather than on rods. 

Testing the photopic visual system is more about object contrast and less on absolute brightness. Under photopic testing conditions, changes in pupil size or crystalline lens color and transparency have less effect on test results. At dimmer, scotopic levels of retinal adaptation, absolute object brightness becomes more important than contrast, and pupil size and media effects become more difficult to control.

Humphrey perimeter uses a standard stimulus duration of 200 milliseconds (ms).

Gaze tracker on the Humphrey perimeter measures gaze direction with a precision of about 1° and automatically records gaze direction each time a stimulus is presented. This could be accomplished somewhat by a ray-cast with 1-degree focus target.

Threshold strategies start testing at a single location in each quadrant of the visual field. If a stimulus is seen, subsequent stimuli at that location are dimmed one step at a time until no longer seen. Conversely, if the initial stimulus is not seen, then subsequent presentations are made brighter in steps until the patient presses the response button. (Some strategies repeat this process for confirmation of the finding, either using the same brightness step size, or perhaps a smaller increment.)

**The speed of the test is calibrated uniquely to the patients response time:**

Test pacing—the time interval between stimuli—is determined by measuring patient response time.

This may be better achieved in the demonstration?

Test Patterns

- 30-2 test pattern measures visual sensitivity at 76 locations within 30° of fixation—the area commonly referred to as the central visual field.
- 24-2 test pattern consists of the 54 most central test locations of the 30-2 pattern.
- 10-2 test with foveal threshold will provide a denser 2-degree grid spacing with a higher number of test points in the very central visual field.
    - Using a Size V stimulus will extend the available sensitivity range, often making it possible to continue following patients with very advanced field loss.

Chapter 5:

Information Presented on the Single Field Analysis (SFA) Report:

1. Demographics and Testing Conditions - Patient name, identification number, date of birth, age, the date and time of testing, visual acuity, pupil size, and eye tested all are presented at the top of the SFA printout.
2. Total Deviation - Total Deviation probability plots identify test locations that are outside normal limits. Threshold sensitivity is compared with the age-corrected normal values at each test point to produce the Total Deviation (TD) numerical map. The statistical significances of these deviations from normal depend upon test point location and the test strategy used, and are indicated in the associated Total Deviation probability plot, in which deviations are highlighted when they are worse than those found in the bottom 5%, 2%, 1%, and 0.5% of sensitivities in normal subjects of the same age as the patient. A key showing the meaning of the symbols is given near the bottom of the printout. A 2% symbol, for instance, indicates that 98% of normal subjects of the same age would be expected to have a sensitivity that is higher than the recorded value. The range of sensitivity found among healthy subjects is larger in the periphery than in the center of the field. Thus, a deviation of 5 dB from age-normal sensitivity is quite unusual—and therefore statistically significant—at the center of the field, but is totally within the normal range of sensitivity in the periphery of the test area.
3. Pattern Deviation - The single most useful analysis on an SFA printout is the Pattern Deviation (PD) probability plot. The Pattern Deviation analysis shows sensitivity losses after an adjustment has been made to remove any generalized depression or elevation of the overall hill of vision. The PD plot uses the same symbols as the Total Deviation plots to identify points deviating by statistically significant amounts from the range of values typically found in healthy subjects. Cataract causes generalized depression, which can complicate detection of localized early glaucomatous defects. By removing the generalized component of field change, the Pattern Deviation analysis can highlight subtle localized loss while largely ignoring cataract effects. The strength of the probability maps is that they ignore results that are within normal variability and highlight subtle, but statistically significant, variations that might otherwise escape notice. Probability maps also help deemphasize common artifactual patterns, such as eyelid-induced depressions of sensitivity in the superior part of the field, that often appear on the grayscale
4. Comparing Total Deviation and Pattern Deviation - It is useful to compare the Total Deviation and Pattern Deviation maps when evaluating clinical cases. If the two maps look more or less the same, then there is little or no generalized depression. On the other hand, a uniformly depressed Total Deviation map combined with a normal-looking Pattern Deviation map probably indicates a cataract (Fig 5-3). The opposite pattern—a Pattern Deviation map that looks more disturbed than its corresponding Total Deviation map—often is associated with a trigger-happy patient who has repeatedly pressed the response button when no stimulus was seen.
5. Glaucoma Hemifield Test - The Glaucoma Hemifield Test (GHT) provides a plain language classification of 30-2 and 24-2 test results based upon patterns of loss commonly seen in glaucoma. Pattern Deviation scores in each of five zones in the upper hemifield are compared to findings in mirror-image zones in the inferior visual field. Scoring differences between mirror image zones are compared to normative significance limits specific to each zone pair.
    1. GHT findings are divided into the following categories:
        1. “Outside Normal Limits” is displayed whenever at least one zone pair differs by an amount found in fewer than 1% of normal subjects.
        2. Fields not classified as Outside Normal Limits are labeled as “Borderline” whenever at least one zone pair differs by an amount found in fewer than 3% but more than 1% of normal subjects.
        3. “General Depression” or “Abnormally High Sensitivity” messages are presented whenever even the best test point locations are either so low or so high as to be at levels seen in fewer than half a percent of normal subjects.
        4. The “Within Normal Limits” message is presented whenever none of the above conditions are met.

Data Events (Reliability Indices):

1. False Positive Response Errors - The false positive (FP) response error score measures the tendency of patients to press the response button even when no stimulus has actually been seen — in order to identify so-called trigger-happy patients.
2. False Negative Errors - The false negative (FN) error score was originally meant to assess patient inattention — and to help identify patients who have failed to respond to stimuli that probably should have been seen. FN rates are measured by occasionally presenting very bright stimuli at test point locations where threshold sensitivity already has been found to be reasonably normal.
3. Fixation Loss Rate - The fixation loss (FL) rate measures patient gaze stability—whether the patient is gazing straight ahead or looking from side to side during the test. FL rates are estimated by periodically presenting stimuli at the presumed location of the patient’s blind spot—the so-called Heijl-Krakau method.
    
    Potential visualization of gaze tracking based on head stability, this in combination with shinning a light in the users blind spot can determine gaze tracking.

Chapter 8:

Frequency of testing - European Glaucoma Society practice guidelines recommend collection of three fields per year—including baseline tests—in the first 2 years after initial diagnosis. This amount of testing usually is enough to detect rapidly progressing eyes—those worsening by 2 dB/year or more.

The US Social Security Administration has defined an MD of 222dB as the threshold for visual disability. An MD of 222dB corresponds to a VFI of approximately 30%.

Humphrey perimeter’s Glaucoma Hemifield Test (GHT) was designed to have an overall specificity of approximately 94% and thus must be expected to produce about 6% false positive findings in normal subjects.

The Untrained Patient and Perimetric Learning - it will be important to have "training" tests that are not reported and run quickly.

Chapter 13:

The distance from the eye to the center of the bowl is 30 centimeters. 

The bowl surface is textured to provide an almost perfectly matte finish; this is
known as a Lambertian surface. Lambertian surfaces are the opposite of mirrors.
They provide almost no direct or specular reflections but instead scatter light diffusely
and equally in all directions. Thus, stimuli projected on this surface will seem equally
bright regardless of viewing angle.

Stimuli of known size and brightness in a known location for a known amount of time.
