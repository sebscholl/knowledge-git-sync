# The Little Prince

In the face of an overpowering mystery, you don't dare disobey.

He had taken seriously inconsequential remarks and grown very unhappy.

The King: "One must command from each what each can perform."

The Prince: "To the vain, everyone is an admirer and they hear nothing - except praise."

The fox: "The only things you learn are the things you tame."

People haven't time to learn anything. They buy things readyade in stores. But since there are no stores in which you can buy friends, people no longer have friends. If you want a friend, tame me!

Language is the source of misunderstanding.

Anything essential is invisible to the eyes.

It's the time you spent on your rose, that makes your rose so important.

It's good to have a friend. Even if you're going to die.

What makes things beautiful is invisible.

You risk tears if you let yourself be tames.

Beer conversation:
Me: Hi!
Beer: I'm a bit cold.
Me: Isn't that how you like to be?
Beer: Do you like being cold?
Me: No
Beer: I'll get used to it.
