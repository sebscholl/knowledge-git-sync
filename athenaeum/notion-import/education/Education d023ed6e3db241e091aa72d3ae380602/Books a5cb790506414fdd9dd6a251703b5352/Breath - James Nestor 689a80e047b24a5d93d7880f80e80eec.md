# Breath - James Nestor

Mis-shapen jaws is largely attributed to improper breathing. There is a long list of detrimental health effects caused by prolonged mouth breathing.

Humans are the only species to consistently suffer from snoring, misaligned jaws, poor dental structure, and other sinus related issue.

The interior of the nose, it turned out, is blanketed with erectile tissue, the same flesh that covers the penis, clitoris, and nipples. Noses get erections. Within seconds, they too can engorge with blood and become large and stiff. This happens because the nose is more intimately connected to the genitals than any other organ; when one gets aroused, the other responds. The mere thought of sex for some people causes such severe bouts of nasal erections that they’ll have trouble breathing and will start to sneeze uncontrollably, an inconvenient condition called “honeymoon rhinitis.” As sexual stimulation weakens and erectile tissue becomes flaccid, the nose will, too.

Breathing through different nostrils has different physiological and emotional effects on the body. Each one simulates the opposing side of the brains and have reverse effects. Right nostril breathing warms the body, increases heart rate, and simulates the prefrontal cortex. Left nostril breathing lowers blood pressure, cools the body, and reduces anxiety.

Shallow breathing used only 10% of available lung capacity, putting extra strain on the heart which leads to cardiovascular issues. This can be mitigated by deeper breathing through the diaphram. 

For every ten pounds of fat lost in our bodies, eight and a half pounds of it comes out through the lungs; most of it is carbon dioxide mixed with a bit of water vapor. The rest is sweated or urinated out.

Prayer heals, especially when it’s practiced at 5.5 breaths a minute. (5.5 inhale, 5.5 exhale, is 5.5 breaths per minute)

Winston price was only half right in his analysis of dental structure between traditional societies and industrial societies. Well sugars and refined foods may have led to tooth decay oh, it was not the culprit of jaw deformity. It was the softness of foods in the industrial era that lacked the fibrosis and toughness that overtime builds strong jaw bones and muscles. This lead to Jaws shrinking, dental arches v-ing and as a result constricting nasal airways that led to mouth breathing.
