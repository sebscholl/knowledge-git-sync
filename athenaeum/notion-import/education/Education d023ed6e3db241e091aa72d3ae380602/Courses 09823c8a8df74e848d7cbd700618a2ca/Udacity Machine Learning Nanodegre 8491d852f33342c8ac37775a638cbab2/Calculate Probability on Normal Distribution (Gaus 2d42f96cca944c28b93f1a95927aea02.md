# Calculate Probability on Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution) with Mean and Standard Deviation

**Probability of value being less than z:**

P(X < z) = (z - mean) / standard_deviation

Round up to two decimal points and find value in normal table.

**Probability of value being greater than z:**

P(X > z) = 1 - ((z - mean) / standard_deviation)

Round up to two decimal points and find value in normal table.

**Probability of value being between z and y:**

P (x > z) and P (x < y) = P2 - P1

Round up to two decimal points and find value in normal table.

**When finding the probabilities using a continuous distribution, the probability of obtaining an exact value is zero.**
