# Effectively target the right audience

**Website**

In the conversion section of the Ad Set, the website section relates to the tracking pixel on target site - and you end up specifying which specific event you are marketing to.

When you start, use the Add to Basket event and the go down the funnel as your Ad Sets optimize.

**Offer**

Don't use it. Gives discount code

**Audience**

This is where you begin setting the demographics information.

It's a good idea to ad a language constraint when dealing in the developed world since many immigrants may skew the audience if it's only Geo layered.

**Custom Audiences:**

Groups of people that have already interacted with you in some way. You can either target them (re-targeting) or you can exclude them from Ad Sets.

**Detailed Targeting:**

This is where we start to create layers. Don't be so generic! (i.e. if you're selling sunglasses don't just make Sunglasses the targeting keyword).

Always use multi-layered targeting:

- Start with high-level/broad keywords (fashion & dresses, shopping and fashion, trendy fashion, etc...) - don't get too detailed in the first layer!
- In the second layer (narrowing the audience) start to do more product specific keywords (eyewear, glasses, mirrored sunglasses, aviator, etc...)
- In the third layer (narrowing further) start to target competitors audience (rayban, hawkers, illisteva, etc...)
- In the fourth layer (narrowing further) start to target some interests (magazines, GQ, Vogue, influencers names, Mr. Porter, etc...)
- In the fifth layer start targeting platforms (where do these people go)
- In the sixth layer start targeting lifestyle attributes (how much do they make, do they travel, are they bloggers, etc...)
- In the seventh layer, start targeting BEHAVIORS. This is different from the interests that we've done. (Spending habits, mobile usage,  )

Keywords can be duplicated across multiple category contexts. Make sure you have the right taxonomy reference!
