# Guide evolution - managing campaign performance

Once you start a campaign, WAIT THREE DAYS. You need to wait 3-days as the Algorithm learns and tests and tries different variations. If your ads get strong initial conditions then they have a high likelihood of trending in the right direction, because the Algo will clamp down and start optimizing on the right people. If you have bad initial conditions, where the wrong people interact with the add then that will change the evolutionary path of your add set. 

Even perfect media, copy, and product combo can fail due to a bad formation period. So be patient for the wait period. This has 10x the impact for success than does the assets used in the campaign.

Launch the 5 messages with 3 angles and 3 assets and wait for the formation period regardless of how formation is going. Spend AT LEAST $10 per Ad Set. Or better, spend enough money to drive at least 3 purchases based on your products price and the marketing spend.

After the formation period, you'll see which ad sets are performing terribly. Then you can turn those off.  You should also start seeing a few ad sets performing well. Facebook will begin allocating more budget to those ad sets. In this exercise, you want to support the Algorithms decision making ability by turning off the under-performers so the the Algo focuses more on those that have potential.

Once turned off the bad performing ads, you can go back to the drawing board and produce new sets (whole new set of variations).

Keep it simple. Run ads, see if they work. When ones do work, combine whats working into new ads that then get more powerful overtime with the algo.

### What constitutes success?

Example:

You spend $80 at a $8 CPM (cost per mil)

- 10,000 impressions = $80 / $8 CPM

You get 150 clicks

- 150 Clicks = $0.50 per click / 1.5% CTR

You get 15 products added to basket

- 15 add to basket = $5 per add to basket / 10% CR

You get 6 trying to checkout

- 6 initiate checkouts = $13 per initiate checkout / 4% CR

And 4 people end up purchasing

- 4 purchases = $20 per purchase / 2.7%

Product price: $50

Ad Revenue: $50 x 4 Purchases = $200

Ad Spend: $80

Return: $200 - $80 = $120 > ROI is the most important KPI

### What constitutes failure?

Example:

High CPM (Cost per 1,000 impressions)

Low click problems:  Page or profile / message / visuals / audience / offer 

Low ad to basket problems: Website / product page / audience / offer 

Low initiate checkout problems: Website checkout process / audience 

Low purchase problems: Checkout process, payment process

Primary diagnosis method: return backwards.

Secondary diagnosis method: first point of failure forwards.

When diagnosing, think in context of "What prevented the person from moving forward in the funnel?"

Simple rule... if your ad set is profitable, SCALE IT.
