# Fulfill Your purpose - Launching the right campaigns

While the algorithm does all the work, you still need to give it focus! This is where you need to give you campaign an objective. 

Objectives:

Awareness

Consideration

Conversion

You can work through each Objective as a funnel.

Advertisers usually use a bucket of Objectives. Facebook actually knows the acting behavior of individuals. 

1. Conversion ads: Best used when you have your own website.
    1. Algo looks for people most likely to purchase from you.
2. Engagement Ads: 
    1. Algo looks for people most likely to like and comment on stuff.
3. Traffic ads: If you don't own the domain and can't ad the pixel, use traffic ads.
4. Lead ads: For collecting contact information.
    1. Most likely to share email address.
5. Reach ads: 
    1. Sends ads to as many people as possible. Cheapest people to reach.

There are different stages of these different objectives. With conversions, for example, the pixel will track:

1. VC = View Content
2. ATB = Add to Basket
3. IC = Initiate Checkout
4. API = Add Payment Information
5. PUR = Purchase

At each stage, you can shoot for retargeting. Almost 60% leave their cart!

For non-conversion ads, you can retarget the engagement so that it re-enters them into the sales funnel. However, it's not always the best strategy since FB looked for people to fulfill a single objective rather than someone to convert. Example, FB know's this person will share their email, but not necessarily their credit card.

Traffic ads are the most appropriate for things like [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com) stores. Sometimes people also use it to drive maximum traffic to their web sites, where they then have the Facebook pixel installed and therefore are able to track the users behavior.

Reach ads are great for re-targeting since the audience has already been filtered. This makes it much more affordable to go after an already segmented audience. This goes for all objective **EXCEPT conversion ads since in that case you want the most accurate data.**
