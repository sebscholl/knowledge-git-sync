# Focus the All Seeing Eye - Working with Facebooks Algorithm

Theory vs. Execution - most people and agencies focus on simply being able to execute Facebook campaigns, which is why they fail. You need to have a wholistic understanding of how the system works to be successful.

Between Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger there is a 4-billion person audience. All of them are fully segmented. 

Advertisers (me) don't actually tell the Facebook algorithm what to do with the ads. The algorithm itself decides on placement.

Think of every ad on the FB platform as a living organism competing for survival, and the algorithm is the survival engine. It determines, by which ads perform the best and are the strongest, which to promote the strongest and keep alive.

The Facebook Algorithm does 90% of the work for the advertiser. We only need to do the 10% of giving the advertisement exactly what it wants. And that boils down to 5-things. Those are:

1. Variation 
    1. Craft winning messages (copy)
    2. Design winning visuals (media)
    3. Choose winning audiences (targets)
2. Use effective funnels
3. Comply with Facebook policies
4. Launch the right campaigns
5. Manage campaign performance
