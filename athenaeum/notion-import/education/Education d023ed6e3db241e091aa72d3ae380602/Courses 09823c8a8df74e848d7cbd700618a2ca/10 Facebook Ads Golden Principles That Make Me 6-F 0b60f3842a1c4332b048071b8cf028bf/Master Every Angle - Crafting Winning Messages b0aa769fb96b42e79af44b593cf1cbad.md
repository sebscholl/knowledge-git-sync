# Master Every Angle - Crafting Winning Messages

Every advertiser has a message that they want to give to their audience and every message has an angle, and the angle is how that message is framed to their audience.

Example:

If you're selling a product, that's the message.

But that message can have many different angles (how are you selling the product)

Angle 1: Product is half priced, ads are delivering the message through that angle

Common mistakes of Advertisers:

1. They only test 1 angle
2. They test multiple variations of the same angle
    1. Example: 50% off, Half off, and Buy 1 get 1 free (same angles)
3. Writing ad copy as you're creating a campaign (not being premeditated)

You need to give the algorithm multiple angles. Each angle is expressed through the headline and caption. 

Give the algorithm a single product (message) though **five different angles.** This means you're 5x more likely to succeed. Each of these angles are differentiated at the **Ad Set** level of the Facebook campaign.
