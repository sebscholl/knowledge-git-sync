# Offer an Appealing Journey - Using effective funnels

              → Goal Failure → Retargeting Ads

You need to make sure that you're journey works before you begin running ads. Make sure you have at least had 3 organic conversions (completed goals) before you begin running ads.

**Funnel Journey:**

Goal → Ads → *Funnel* → Goal Success → Retargeting Ads

                              → Goal Failure → Retargeting Ads

In the Funnel Journey, the lead is not sent directly to the product, they are sent to a piece of media or a helpful insight. That thing then helps nurture the person into buying the product or service. 

Depending on the product you're selling, and the audience you're selling it to, you'll get different results from the funnel. So make sure to think about whether what you're selling demands such nurturing, or whether it could be a simple product sale.

Rules of thumb:

Product is less than $50, it's likely OK to go direct to sale

**Example Product Funnel:**

Ads → Article → Product Page → Sale

**Example Ads Services Funnel:**

Ads → Video → Appointment → Sale

"Leakage" is when people fall out at the different stages of the funnel. (eg. if a person watches a video and doesn't make it to the next step, there's leakage there.) Retargeting is the best way to combat leakage, as those people are not lost and need to be re-introduced to the funnel.

Advertising to cold traffic is the hardest kind of sale. Retargeting is what creates warm traffic which has significantly higher successful conversion rates (recapturing the leaks). 

Ads + Email marketing campaigns are the most valuable ROI for marketing reach.
