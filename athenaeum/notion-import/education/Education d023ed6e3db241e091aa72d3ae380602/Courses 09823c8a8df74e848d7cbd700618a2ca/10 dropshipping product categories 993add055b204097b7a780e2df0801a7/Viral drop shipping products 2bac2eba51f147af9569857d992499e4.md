# Viral drop shipping products

These are products that attract high attention and engagement and make people end up wanting to share them with other people that they know.

Examples:

1. Animal paw socks (cute and funny so people would share)
2. Self stirring mug (someone brings it to office and others might want one)
3. Desktop punching bag (appeals to anger - almost a meme)

Don't need to reinvent the wheel, just steal it. When you see great video ads, re-produce them to sell the same products.

Viral products usually need to tap into one of three things:

1. Unusually funny
2. Unusually useful
3. Unusually great deal

These products, when done correctly, are cheaper to promote due to their virality and they are easier to sell since someone will go FOMO of the novelty.
