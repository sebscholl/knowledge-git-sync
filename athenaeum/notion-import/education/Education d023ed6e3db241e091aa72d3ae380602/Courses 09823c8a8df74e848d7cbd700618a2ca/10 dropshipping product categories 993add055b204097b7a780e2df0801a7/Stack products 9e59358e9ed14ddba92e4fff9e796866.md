# Stack products

Stack products are products that come in variated packs. The goal here is to advertise 1 product while then encouraging the behavior of getting multiple purchased. 

Examples:

1. Mens bracelets (3 pack with different beads)
2. Shoes (more than 1 color)
3. Yoga pants (people want more than 1)

These products are characterized by coming in different sizes, styles, or shapes. They improve conversion rates by giving customers a wider choice variety and maximize your average order value by customers buying more than 1 item.
