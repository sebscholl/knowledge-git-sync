Products you sell at certain times of the year.

Examples:

1. Gloves for winter
2. Sunglasses for summer
3. Special gifts for the Holidays
4. Annual international days (Valentines day, St Patty's, etc...)

These are planned products that should resonate with your audience and have enough time to ship.

These are a good way to keep your store fresh and have some rotating inventory and engage customers.

Think of these more so as promotion opportunities than anything.
