WASHINGTON, DC - Following this mornings news that the US Government has been secretly collecting data on millions of Verizon users, Americans nation wide have expressed concerns that the government may not be properly handling the countless phone sex recordings and dirty text messages that they have obtained.  Arguing that, "[they] don't just want any random surveillance officer reviewing the nudie pics, lewd text messages, and orgasmic audio recording that Americans send everyday", prominent rights activists are demanding government assurance that this sensitive information will be properly handled.  Therefore, Vice President Joe Biden declared this morning that he will be taking the responsibility of screening the inappropriate data by himself in a private room beneath the white house.  "The administration understands our citizen's concerns.  But at the same time we believe it's crucial to our national security that this data be reviewed", said Biden while walking to his new windowless office.  "That's why it's probably best if I just take a look at all this stuff to make sure there is nothing suspicious."  At press time sources reported a large shipment of tissues and hand lotion being delivered to the white house.
