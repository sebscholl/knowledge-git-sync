**News Brief**

BOSTON – Early this morning during a level two Spanish course, conservative student Jeremy Way was super impressed by his professor assuring the class that he was not trying to bias them - moments before brutally slandering any and all beliefs that were even remotely right wing. “Look, I’m not here to tell you guys what’s right or wrong.  We are all entitled to our own opinions and millions of Americans have sacrificed their lives to preserve us that right - I couldn’t live with myself knowing that I’m creating an un-accommodating environment to those who have different beliefs,” said professor Gonzales seconds before stating that anyone who supports the Tea Party is an ignorant elitist asshole who doesn’t care about anyone but themselves and should be shot.  Additionally, Way reported that Gonzales often goes off on tangents completely unrelated to course material during which he explains to students how their beliefs are pathetically uninformed and flawed; however, he takes great comfort in that Gonzales promotes a free thinking and open-minded classroom.
