4:30am - CHICAGO – Consumers anxiously line up at local sporting stores to be the first persons to purchase Under Armor's newest product, The Commitment Shirt®.  Featuring the company’s latest technology, which promotes muscle growth for the wearer, this is no ordinary athletic garment.

After years of market research and product development, Under Armor CEO, Kevin Plank, feels that his team has struck oil.  “For years we’ve consistently received customer complaints.  One message that has been regularly received, though, was that our products weren’t delivering customers the fitness results they desired.  This inspired me to pull together the team, brainstorm, and develop The Commitment Shirt®”, said Plank during an interview at the company's Baltimore headquarters last week.

Many are still skeptical of the shirt's muscle building ability.  Even though data collected from product testers has shown results far surpassing expectations.  In summary, testers who wore the shirt at least three times a week for two month began to see measurable improvements in their muscle development.  Additionally, results were magnified in users who also practiced healthy eating regimens.

The Commitment Shirt® utilizes the most cutting edge sports lifestyle technologies.  By placing a microscopic gyroscope into the hem at the back of the neck, the shirt features hands free operation and is motion activated.

The operations are quite simple.  To turn the shirt "on", simply stand at arms distance from the nearest wall.  Proceed to place hands on the wall and slowly lean forwards before pushing back out, repeating the motion eight to ten times.

"The possibilities are endless!" Says Anthony Brown, VP of marketing at Under Armor.  "We have now only scratched the surface of what's possible with this new technology.  With the release of The True Commitment Shirt® coming out later this month [a similar shirt designed for athletes with more ambitious fitness goals] we definitely have our hands full.  However, I excitedly anticipate the development of this same technology adapted to running shorts that will burn body fat, as well as a lead core and iron plated sports bracelet that builds arm strength.  The arm bracelets are already ready for production - we are just looking for the perfect slogan to imprint on them."
