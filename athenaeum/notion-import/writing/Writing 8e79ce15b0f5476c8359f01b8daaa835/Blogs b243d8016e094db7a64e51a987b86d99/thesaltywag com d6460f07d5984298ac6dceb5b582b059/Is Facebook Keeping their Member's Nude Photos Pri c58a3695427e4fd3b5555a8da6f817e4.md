SILICON VALLEY – Buried in allegations, Facebook, Inc. is litigating multiple lawsuits brought on by adults and teenagers claiming that the widely popular social media site is not keeping their nude photos private enough.

Arizona State University student Haley Young found herself distraught and confused ensuing rejection for employment from her company of choice, IBM.  After emailing a friend – who works at the company - to ask why she had not been hired, she was informed that it was due to an HR manager viewing a photo of her on Facebook.

The photograph was of Young doing a topless keg-stand with her friends at an ASU tailgate party - which was caption, “OMG whitegurl wasted #YOLO #college #footballbiddy”.  Despite this photo being one of many that influenced IBM’s decision - including “selfies” of Young modeling her latest Victoria's Secret purchases, as well as showing off tattoos not visible with clothing – she feels that it is not fair.

“If Facebook is going to allow me to post lewd and scandalous pictures of myself, they have a responsibility to protect my privacy”, argued Young at a courthouse hearing last Wednesday.  “Out of Facebook’s billion users, I thought that only my friends would be able to see the photos I post.”

Young is not the only person taking action against Facebook for its lack of ownership of individual privacy and discretion.  Parents across the nation are deeply concerned whether Facebook may be the reason that their kids are being denied acceptance to colleges.

“My son was recently denied from Georgetown University due to the admissions office seeing a picture of him showing off his physic while holding only one hand in front of his groin.  How could Facebook have conscionable let Georgetown see that?” argued Derrick Taylor, father of two.

This issue reaches far beyond nude photos, though.  With millions of pictures exposing underage drinking, illicit drug use, and a variety of erotic experiences uploaded each day, one thing is absolute.  Facebook must take responsibility for protecting users from wreaking their futures by having professionals view the malapropos images that members frequently post.
