NEW YORK, NEW YORK – It is not even 3:00pm and sons and daughters across the city of Manhattan have already began raging in celebration of fathers day.  Since the crack of dawn club promoters and restaurants have not stopped receiving calls from anxious offspring in hopes of reserving spots for them and their friends at NYC’s top venues for the night.  As of now though, pre-games densely packed with appreciative youth have commenced across the city's rooftops – echoing music and screams of excitement throughout the streets.  Unfortunately not all of the fathers who are being celebrated were able to attend or invited to the celebrations; however, even though later they will be in their children’s faces, for now their presence is fondly our hearts.
