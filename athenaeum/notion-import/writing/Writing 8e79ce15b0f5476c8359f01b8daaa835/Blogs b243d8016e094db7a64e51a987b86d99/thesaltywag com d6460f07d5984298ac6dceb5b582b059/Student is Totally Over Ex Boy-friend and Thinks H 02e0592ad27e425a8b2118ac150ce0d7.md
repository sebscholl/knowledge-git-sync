BOSTON – After being dumped by her boyfriend [John] a few months ago, BU student Jessica Jensen is now telling everyone that she is, “totally over him”.  Once again a socialite, Jensen now spends her time going out, meeting new people, and telling her friends how over her ex boyfriend she is.  “Like, I can’t believe I even dated him.  He’s such a loser!” said Jensen while looking at John’s Facebook on a Friday night at 11:00pm.  Now that John has a new girlfriend, Jensen has become even more vocal about how pathetic she thinks he really is – pointing out how unattractive his new girlfriend would be if she didn’t have any of her attractive qualities.  “Look at these pictures, she’s such a slut”, said Jensen while looking through John’s new girlfriend’s Facebook later that same night.  “She thinks she is so hot” “You can tell, though, that if she didn’t smile, didn’t have blond hair, lost her tan, got a breast reduction, and wasn’t model like skinny that she wouldn’t even be good looking.”  Additionally, after reading John’s latest tweet about “summer break in Mexico with the girlfriend”, Jenson told everyone how John will never have as much fun as when she went with him on break.
