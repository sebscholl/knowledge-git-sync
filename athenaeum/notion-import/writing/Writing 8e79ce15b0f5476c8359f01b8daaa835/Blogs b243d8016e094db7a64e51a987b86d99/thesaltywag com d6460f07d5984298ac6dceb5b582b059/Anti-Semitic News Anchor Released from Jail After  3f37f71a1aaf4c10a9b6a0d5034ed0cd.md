NEW YORK CITY – On Easter day, well known news anchor Gerald Levi was taken into custody after saying an anti-Semitic comment during a live news report.  Following yesterdays hearing at a downtown courthouse, Levi’s charges were dismissed after Judge Stein had been convinced the defendant was in fact Jewish.

Levi’s comment brought much negative attention upon the news network.  His reference to a community church offering free ham on Easter as a “Jews Catch 22” immediately jeopardized his reputation, and very possibly, his career.

Fortunately though, by exposing his genitalia to the jury and dancing the Mezinke with perfect technique, the court felt it had sufficient evidence to conclude that Levi was Jewish himself, thus making his slandering comment completely acceptable.

“In a world as sensitive as our own, one cannot be too careful when dealing with racial and religious issues”, said Judge Stein in an interview following the verdict. “While we must stay firm against discrimination among people of different races and faith’s, we find no reason to reprimand self-deprecating humor within those groups.”
