MALDEN, MA – After a long and successful run, the John Wiley & Sons, Inc., has discontinued their *For Dummies* books series after realizing that ‘dummies these days can’t even read’.  Sullenly picking up the last printed copy of *Foreclosure Investing For Dummies – A Step-By-Step Guide to Investing in Real Estate Foreclosures*, CEO John Wiley expressed how doomed he now feels the *Dummies Books* series was from the beginning.  “Before YouTube and Google at least people knew that reading was an important skill, but now everyone thinks that no knowledge is more than a few videos away”, “plus, too many of our *Dummies* books covered topics that dummies don’t even know exist!  I mean, God, most Americans are too busy worrying about being foreclosed on, how could they even conceptualize, let alone read, about foreclosure investing!”  Not knowing what to do with the tens-of-thousands of untouched *Dummies* books, Wiley has begun compiling his own extensive private library – believing that at the US’s current intelligence depreciation rate, his *Dummies* library may one day be the equivalent to an ivy league education.
