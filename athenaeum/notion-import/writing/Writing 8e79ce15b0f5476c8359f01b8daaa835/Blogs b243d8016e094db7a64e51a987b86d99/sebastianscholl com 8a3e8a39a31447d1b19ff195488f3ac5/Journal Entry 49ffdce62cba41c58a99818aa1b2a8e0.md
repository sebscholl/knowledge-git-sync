On the way to work this morning I found myself greeted in Joseph’s home with buckwheat breakfast before backtracking back north near where I had come from to attend Yoga class at FIU. Bonnie, the teacher, actually taught a great class - and before it commenced I met Donny who is going to introduce us to his friend James Whitefield - the man opening the new brewery in Wynwood.

Think Tank Coffee from Australia sent us an email today though with the instructions on how to put a nitrogen cold brew on tap…or what ever it’s called. That is posted here:

"For the cold brew we brewed in beer fermentation tanks after we put the brew into 50L beer kegs and charged with nitrogen. They were served at the stand using a portable glycol refrigeration unit and beer taps installed in the bench above”

In the car driving with Joseph to Yoga though we talked big picture and how to divide it up. I think that we are going to need to divide the idea of Ninety Plus into the three or four companies that truly make it up. A clearer view of the coffee industry and company now are my next and most crucial steps.

**Contacts of the Day:**

- I have not formally met him yet, but Joe and I were introduced to Johnathan Wakefield <[jjw3477@aol.com](mailto:jjw3477@aol.com)> who is open and will own the James Wakefield Brewery. He ran a successful kick-starter campaign.
