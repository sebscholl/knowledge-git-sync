10 days ago I wrote a short post about how my father had acquired an amazing collection of approximately 600 different antique beer cans. Just moments ago he sent me this picture, displaying his newest addition to the man cave. I think it's awesome. After a few hours of drilling shelves into the cinder block wall, he was able to set up this amazing display for the collection right above the shuffleboard table. The only bad part about this is that I'll now most likely be distracted while playing shuffle board - but hell, I'll live.
