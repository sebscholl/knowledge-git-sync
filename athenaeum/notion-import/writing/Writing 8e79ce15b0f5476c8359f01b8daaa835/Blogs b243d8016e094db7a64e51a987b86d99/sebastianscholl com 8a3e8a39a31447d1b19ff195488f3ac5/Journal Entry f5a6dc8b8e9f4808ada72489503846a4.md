There have been a few periods in my life where I had a strong vision of myself going minimalist. They were mainly motivated by esthetic concern, though, it was always a fun mind set to embody. Simply living with what one needs is not an act of giving away till you're left with nearly nothing. It's a mental filtration process which forces an individual to adapt themselves to living comfortably with less options. This doesn't mean living with out quality or sophistication. If you love photography and constantly take pictures, there is no need to give away your camera! The best example of what we rarely let go is clothes and toys. Boxes upon boxes in attics and garages are filled with the past times which we will only again revisit in thought. At first it feels odd to let something go that once had meaning to you. But all it takes is practice, and after awhile we realize all those boxes are just memories.

The New York Times recently published an article talking to the same point. It's a worthwhile read:

When a man named Andrew Hyde began an adventure in minimalism, he [only owned 15 things.](https://andrewhy.de/the-15-things-i-own/) It eventually moved to 39 and now it sits around 60. It all started when he decided to take a trip around the world and sell everything he didn’t need. As Mr. Hyde noted on his blog, it changed his life after a brief period of befuddlement:

> I’m so confused by this. When we were growing up, didn’t we all have the goal of a huge house full of things? I found a far more quality life by rejecting things as a gauge of success.
> 

When I came across his original story of only owning 15 items, I was so inspired I immediately went home and found 15 things to give away. Most of these things were clothes that I had long since stopped wearing, but I held on them because . . . well, just because. In fact I have no idea why I still had a tie I hadn’t worn in four years or a shirt that no longer fit.

I still own way more than 39 things, but getting rid of some of them felt amazingly good. In the process, I realized how much holding on to those things was actually costing me. That is the paradox.

When we hold on to stuff we no longer want or use, it does indeed cost us something more, if only in the time spent organizing and contemplating them. I can’t tell you how many times I have thought about getting rid of that tie (for instance), and every time I went to choose a shirt for the day, I would think about the few that no longer fit.

Even though Hyde’s example is an extreme one, I love thinking about extreme examples because they have the power to compel us to act. In this case I found myself thinking:

- Why exactly do you own what you own?
- What could you get rid of and not miss?
- Do I really still need that?
- What is it costing me to own that?

Maybe the attachment to stuff comes in part from a notion that we should be prepared for anything. When David Friedlander interviewed Mr. Hyde about his project, [he highlighted this issue](https://www.lifeedited.com/2012/04/3-lessons-from-a-guy-with-39-possessions/):

> Americans in particular like to be prepared for the worst-case-scenario, having separate cookie cutters for Christmas and Halloween. We seldom consider how negligible the consequences are when we running out of something or are unprepared. Nor do we consider how high the consequences are for being over-prepared…
> 

Think about that for a second: there’s a consequence for being over-prepared. Often that consequence goes beyond the financial cost. It can easily have a physical cost that we didn’t expect, say in the need for more space to put all of our stuff.

In a way, this all circles back to the notion of [buying good things and holding on to them for a long time](https://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/the-case-for-spending-a-little-more-sometimes/). It can help to think in terms of, “Do I have room—physical, emotional, mental—to bring one more thing into my life?”

If the idea of cutting down on your possessions is equally appealing, but still daunting, start simple:

1. At the end of every season, go through your clothes. If you didn’t wear it one time, get rid of it.
2. This process will generate a stack of stuff. For what it’s worth, don’t try to sell it on eBay. It’s another cost (in time). So save yourself a headache, donate it to a charity and take the tax credit.

You don’t need to get down to 39 possessions to feel the impact. Instead, this exercise is about getting clear on why you own what you own and what it might be costing you to own it.
