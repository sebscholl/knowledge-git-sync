I was privileged to have an upbringing that allowed me the flexibility to travel extensively both on my own and with my family. I was homeschooled. From Panama to Tibet I was constantly on the move, embracing adventures and acquiring knowledge that only firsthand experience yields. This is where my passion for hands-on learning was founded, and why I find education through experience to be invaluable.

The London Internship Program presents a perfect opportunity for me to build towards my goal of working and living abroad after graduation from BU. As a transfer student into the BU School of Hospitality, my International Work Experience requirement was waived. This program will allow me the otherwise lost opportunity of working internationally, in a great multicultural city, while staying on track academically.

My preferred internship environment delegates me managerial responsibilities in an independent or corporate food and beverage company. The internship would offer training in the systematic and procedural functions of food and beverage operations while simultaneously fostering creativity in its employees. Whether this opportunity is in a boutique cocktail bar or a management company, my goal is to learn the operations of the food and beverage industry in an international setting

Through the agriculture and cuisine, music and arts, customs and language, the culture of a place is exposed. I anticipate wandering through galleries, sampling new cuisines, exploring the Markets and Fairs, catching live performances of local artists, and just having a beer in some whole-in-the wall pub that only Locals know about and getting to know some Locals!

I have always been a traveler - a backpack, a few articles of clothing, and a plane ticket to anywhere is a scenario Iâ€™m more than comfortable with. I look forward to the opportunity to become a temporary resident and full time participant in the London Internship Program.
