6:30am morning to drive over to Hyannis and make the earliest Ferry to Martha's Vineyard. This is my first time, and I'm ecstatic. Going over to meet the seasonnaires, but I already have met some old timers who have given me detailed memories of the old days here. The ferry glided across blue glass in a short 50 minutes to arrive in Oak Bluff, and I was just instructed in de-board...

Walked in Soft as a Grape immediately after stepping off and picked up my proof of arrival. The island is one of the few places I've been where the perfection you expect is the perfection you experience. Small Colonial wood houses stained by the sun that's worn them down to colorfully chipped paints, set next to each other at a distance that demands good neighbors. I'm meeting up with Zach and Lucy, the Martha's vineyard Seasonnaires in 5.
