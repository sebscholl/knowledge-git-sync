There are some days where my mind goes blank.  And on these days writing anything that is even slightly thoughtful is near impossible.  So, today I decided to embrace it - here is a completely pointless, but hopefully entertaining, post.

Bringing a girl home is always a slightly awkward experience...at least for me.  I'm always nervous about whether my apartment is put together - wont even bother if it is a mess - and simply don't know how to carry a conversation.  This is with girls I've never met before...of course.  So today while playing around on StumbleUpon I came across a picture of some ridiculously fantastic bed that made me immediately think two things; 1) I NEED to sleep in that, and 2) Imagine bringing a girl home and the look on her face when she walks into your bedroom.

So, here is the list of the most bizarre beds I could find on the internet - and image (girls) if you were to walk into a guys room to see this, or (guys) if you were to bring a girl back home to one of these.

Chubby chasers, chase no more!

Don't jump on your bed, jump with your bed.

"There is a banana in my bedroom...and what you're thinking is only partially right"

Anyone with a flying mattress could get any one to do anything.

Even sleep in a coffin.

To often would chicks want to be in my nest.

Suggestive, and seemingly comfortable.
