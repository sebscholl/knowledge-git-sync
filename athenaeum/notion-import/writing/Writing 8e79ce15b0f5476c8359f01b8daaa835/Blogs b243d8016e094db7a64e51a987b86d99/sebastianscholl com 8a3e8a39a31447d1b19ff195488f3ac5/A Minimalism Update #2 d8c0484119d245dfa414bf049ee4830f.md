For those who didn't read my previous posts on minimalism, please do to better understand this post.

Dear Ebay, Craigslist, GoodWill and The Buffalo Exchange - thank you for helping me get rid of the things I owned.

Seriously, though, in the 6 weeks it's been since embarking on the minimalist route I've been able to rid myself of over 150 different clothes, my TV, some furniture, many unneeded trinkets that cluttered my room, and a TON of stress.  Additionally, I made back about $1,500 from sales.  I'll admit, there were tough moments along the way, but I'll touch on that in another post.

My greatest milestone so far is that I've was able to scale down to 32 articles of clothing...and feel completely comfortable.  While options are important, it has never been easier to quickly throw on an outfit in the morning - and these are the clothes I've always had.  There are a few pieces that I'm lacking in my wardrobe (dress shoes, casual button down and sweater); however, I still have non-essentials in my 32 collection that could be replaced.

Just in-case you were curious, this lists everything in my closet:

- 2 Jeans (Blue/Gray)
- 2 Shorts
- 1 Chinos
- 1 Slacks
- 2 Buttondowns
- 3 Scarves
- 2 Sport Coats
- 1 Coat
- 1 Fleece
- 3 Shoes
- X Socks (don't count....)
- 1 Bathing suite
- 1 Workout shorts
- 3 White T's
- 3 Black T's
- 2 Tank Tops
- 3 Long sleeve henleys
- 1 Belt

(and I'm wearing a different outfit everyday)

The transition was surprisingly easy.  All the things I use to dedicate high emotional maintenance fees to left me feeling richer than ever once gone.  This made me wonder, how much further can I go?

While I still have furniture to return to my parents and items listed on Ebay, my clean, empty, and peaceful room inspired a new goal.  Next semester I will bring only one carry-on bag, and return with only one carry one bag, when going to London for the semester.  My belief - which may be wrong - is that doing this will focus my energies on the experiential aspects of study abroad, instead of material preservation and accumulation.

“Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”

Saint Exupery

Lastly, by having and spending less I'm quickly realizing that whenever there is something I need, I'm much less concerned about the price tag.
