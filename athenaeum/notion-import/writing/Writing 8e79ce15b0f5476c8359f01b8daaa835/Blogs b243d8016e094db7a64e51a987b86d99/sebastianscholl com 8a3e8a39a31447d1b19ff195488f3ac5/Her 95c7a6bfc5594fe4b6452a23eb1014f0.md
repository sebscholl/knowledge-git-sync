She makes me want more. Her ghost lives nestled against my side. Holding sovereignty over my subconscious when we’re apart. Her touch is an irrepressible distraction when I can’t have it. When I can, there are no distractions; just her. She has saturated me. And I want more.

The love I give her she welcomes. The love she gives me I welcome. Our love we celebrate. We’ve found the confidence, comfort and courage in one another to constantly explore. Together and on our own.

We’re neither person's crutch. Both of us stand tall on our own. I respect and cherish that; her independent mind and her respect of mine. I fight to be my best self for her. Knowing that she wouldn’t tolerate anything less, because she deserves nothing less. Her confidence I find irresistible.

We are constantly in flux. Transitioning seamlessly between being best friends, lovers, and simply ourselves. No urge must I restrain her, nor must her restrain from me. I ask her anything. Her opinion matters to me. We ravish each other; slap, pin, lick, spit, and fuck until exhaustion. We make love to each other; caress, tease, ease, and embrace until satisfaction. We can just be with each other; enjoy silence, dream, talk, socialize, play, and recharge.

Somehow, all so very, very often, our frequencies align. I’m wide-eyed for our adventures to come.
