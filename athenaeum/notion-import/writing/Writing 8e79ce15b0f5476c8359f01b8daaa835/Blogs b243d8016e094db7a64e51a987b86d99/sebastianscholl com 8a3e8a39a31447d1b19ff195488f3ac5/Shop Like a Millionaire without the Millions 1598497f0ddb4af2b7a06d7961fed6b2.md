When I talk to people about minimalism they often understand it as a rejection of materialism.  This is only partly true - the reason being that the only thing I've become adverse to is the constant accumulation in consumer society.  Now that I only have 32 articles of clothing and very few possessions doesn't mean that I have any negative emotions for material goods - it's simply a dedicated mentality of quality over quantity.

The reason I say this is because I love clothes and other consumer products.  And the few that I do own I care very much about.  If I'm only going to own one pair of dress shoes, two pairs of jeans, or one pair of chinos, I better really, really like them.

That is why when it came to organizing my wardrobe I decided to go bespoke.  While I knew that the world of denim could supply me with a perfect fit and style, as well as the folks at Allen Edmond's, I had yet to find a brand that made shirts and pants I could wear comfortably on a daily basis - and always look put together.  I felt out a couple companies, but the one which gave me the most personalized product, warm service, and reasonable price was [Blank Label.](http://www.blanklabel.com/)

Blank Label provides custom made clothing at the same price you pay for off the rack items.  Since they have an office right down on Newbury St, Boston, I was able to show up one day and get measured for a dress shirt and pair of chinos.  Within two weeks they were on my door step.  The fit wasn't exactly where I wanted it, so they happily made alterations at no extra cost.  And now, I have perfectly fitted shirts and chinos.

It is definitely more of a time investment than traditional shopping, but here is the greatest perk (for me).  Unless Cinnabon becomes a staple in my diet or someone throws miracle-grow into my morning smoothies, I can get perfectly fitted clothes made to order.  Therefore, the next time I need a new shirt, pair of pants, jacket, or whatever, I can just give Blank Label a call - pick the fabric, color, style, everything - and have them ship the garment wherever in the world I might be.

It is important to dress well, and a bullet proof strategy to doing so is only buying clothes that were meant for you.  Even if you have no interest in being a wardrobe minimalist but instead shop like it's going out of style (...), I'd recommend giving Blank Label a shot.  It is personalized service for personalized products at the same cost of the impersonal retail experience we are all too familiar with.
