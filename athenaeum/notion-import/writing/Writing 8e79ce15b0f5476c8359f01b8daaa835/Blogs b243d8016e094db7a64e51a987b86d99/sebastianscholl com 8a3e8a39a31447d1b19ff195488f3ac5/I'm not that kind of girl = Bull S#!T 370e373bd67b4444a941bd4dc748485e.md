This post may get me slapped, but whatever.  From my later high school years to this afternoon I've had countless girls say to me "I'm not that kind of girl", or "I'm a good girl".  Of course, they always informed me of this fun fact when I was either trying to bring them home, had them home, or sometimes even while we were hooking-up.  When I was younger, I believed them.  And would usually move on my merry way after hearing it, assuming I wasn't going to crack that nut.  However, with age comes wisdom.

Comically, the responses "don't worry, I'm not that kind of guy", "you didn't seem like every other girl", or simply ignoring them will work most of the time to make them forget that they're "not like that".  But even better, I've just come to learn that if a girl ever tells me that she's a good one, it's a 99% chance that we're about to hook-up...or she's crazy.  The reason being that girls only say this when trying to convince themselves that they are "good", not me.

Plus, whenever you feel obligated to tell someone that you're "good" it's usually because your are being "bad" - think about it.  It's like how people always (myself included) will tell you that they don't really eat desert just before ordering the fudge Sunday special.  The girls I know who I consider "good" and actually don't do hook-ups have never told me, or anyone for that matter, of their so called purity - simply because they never find themselves in situations where they'd need to.

Telling me that you're a "good girl" while laying on my couch at 3:00am after meeting me that night at a sports bar is like telling me you're a vegetarian after ordering a prime rib.  All I can do is nod and say "well isn't that interesting!"  The same goes for guys (myself included) who try to think of themselves as good guys.  I constantly catch myself thinking, "you know what Sebastian, you're really over this whole hook-up thing and just want to find a girl who's serious."  Meanwhile I'm running from bar to bar buying tequila shots for whoever is wearing the shortest skirt.

At the end of the day, who cares.  But if you are one of those people who is a human...there's a good chance that your self image is a pretty distant to your actions.  So the next time you try telling someone about what kind of person you are, think about whether you are trying to convince them of it, or yourself.
