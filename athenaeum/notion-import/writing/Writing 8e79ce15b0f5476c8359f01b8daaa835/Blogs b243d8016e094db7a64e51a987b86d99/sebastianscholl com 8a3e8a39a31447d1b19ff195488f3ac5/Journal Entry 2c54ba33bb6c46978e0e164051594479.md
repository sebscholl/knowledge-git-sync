**The green house**

dries the coffee. It's spread out no more than 2cm in depth across plastic or metal screened drying racks on two tiers. Tempuratuer and humidity gauges keep track of the respective purpose and the plastic walls are either raised or lowered to compensate the in house conditions.Â At different states of drying it calls for different conditions, som as high as 120 degrees.

Then **the kiln** works similarly to the green house, from what I've seen. Black metal walls and hard plastic/milky clear roof creat a super hot room with up to five tiered shelves. There are also fans (both top and bottom) and thermostats and humidistats to regulate Tempuratuer.

the kiln walls are insulated about 5 inches thinck with fiber glass. On the inside, wood. On the outside, thin metal painted black. the flooring is a cement type particle board. And the whole structer is elevated about 2 feet from the ground with cement blocks.

Out of the whole structure, the shelves could be best improved upon. By functionality standards, though. Now they are clunky and heavy.

**THE KILN AND GREEN HOUSE SERVE THE SAME PURPOSE**. If a coffee goes in one, it does not go in the other. The Kiln is used for specialty small batches, and the green house for more bulk operations.

**FARM LAND**

Two main shade varieties:

Higuerilla (castor): very fast growing and large leaves. 8 point leaves.

Poro: triangular leaves and large growth in 4 to 5 years.

Palo Blanco takes longer, but has magic properties for the coffee grown under its shade
