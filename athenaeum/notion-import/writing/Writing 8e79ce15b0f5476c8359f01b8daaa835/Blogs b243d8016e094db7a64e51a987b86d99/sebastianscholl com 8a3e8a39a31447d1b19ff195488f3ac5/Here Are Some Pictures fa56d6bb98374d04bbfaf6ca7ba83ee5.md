The most successful people I've met can accomplish more by lunch on a Monday than I do with an entire week.  Time never runs short for them, they just keep doing.  And as a result, everything they want to do gets done.  Being aware of this has encouraged me to never believe I'm too busy, never believe I don't have the time, but instead look myself in the mirror when feeling overwhelmed and say, "you're just lazy".

This morning I did just that.  While washing up for the day I tried convincing myself that I've been to busy to keep up with the things I love.  The past few days made up my first week working with the Jamie Oliver Foundation, and foolishly I allowed the 8-hour work day to push aside passions; writing, fitness, photography, among others.  I couldn't credit any of my woes though - I knew I was just being lame.

It's odd where we find inspiration - whenever I start feeling lazy at the gym it takes just one night of watching 300 and Spartacus to get me back on track.  It's important to recognize ways to motivate yourself, whether they seem silly or not.  Because at the end of the day, if it works it works.  Today my source of inspiration to stop being lazy - of all things - was watching Richard Branson interviews on YouTube.  Needless to say, he's very, very cool, and quite an inspirational guy.

One of the most productive periods of my life was when I was one of four guys who made up a sort of morning club.  Four days a week at 6:00am we'd be on a conference call discussing our goals for the day, and from there we'd execute.  If I'm rich in any sense, it's with time and energy.  And damn me if I don't abusively exploit those resources.

In this post are the few images I did take in the past week.  I'm taking the rest of the evening to organize a more productive lifestyle.
