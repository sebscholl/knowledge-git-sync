I've always wished that I didn't have the insecurities and fears that I do - everyone does.  We imagine how much happier our lives would be if we weren't constantly wishing that we were more attractive, wealthy, smart, athletic, and so on.  Often people encourage us [people with insecurities...so everyone] to "embrace ourselves", saying that it is important to love who you are as you are.  But I find that strategy to be unsustainable because you can only trick yourself into being happy with your flaws for so long.

Personally, I accredit who I am as a person to my insecurities and fears, in a good and bad way.  The reason being that there are two ways to handle an insecurity or fear.  The first is to let it conquer you - allowing it to be the excuse for why you are unable or not good enough to do or be something or someone you want.  Lets be honest, most people allow their fears and insecurities to ruin their lives.  They never even try to achieve their dreams out of fear of failure or a low sense of self worth.

The other way is to fight them.  Constantly work towards beating them down and proving them wrong.  It is an inner struggle that often cannot be won, but one that gives us purpose in our daily lives.  It is in this struggle that we develop a true since of self by realizing our greatest strengths and weaknesses.  And only by doing so are we able to better ourselves.  By battling my own insecurities and fears this way I learned one extremely valuable lesson - fears and insecurities are life's most powerful motivators.

I've always been insecure of my fears and feared my insecurities.  And having this mindset has made much of my life a game of Jenga with blocks of emotion.  I'm constantly trying to get rid of one until they all come crashing down.  However, even though I do suffer the occasional mental breakdown to be found crying under a cold shower, my insecurities and fears have pushed me to try many of my most extraordinary experiences, as well as acquire many skills.

Me - Age 11

Here's a simple example.  When I was younger my nickname was the Michelin Man.  If you do not know who the Michelin Man is you can look him up, or just know that he is made out of rubber tires...I was "big boned".  It wasn't even friends or bullies that deemed me the name, it was my family.  That name drove me crazy!  I hated it.  By age 11 I had the same body complex issues of a 40-year-old woman; I wouldn't even take my shirt off at beach.  Simply because I hated and was insecure of my body and feared ridicule.  It sucked, no doubt about it.  But thanks to it, once I got older I started working out, playing sports, and trying to improve myself.  Instead of trying to accept who I was, I used my insecurity as a motivator to help myself change to who I wanted to be.  Over time this attitude invariably drove me to develop a deep understanding of and appreciation for the two most important aspects of my life; health and fitness.

Me - Age 21

In a way it's ironic, but as long as I live I'll always be insecure of my body.  Even though I've worked my ass off (literally) to get in shape and be healthy, at the end of the day I'll always look into the mirror and think of the Michelin Man.  So on the one hand my insecurity is an endless torment, but on the other hand it's the motivator I must thank for helping me become who I am.  Should I love it, or hate?  Is it worth fighting a battle you cannot win, or better to opt for contentment?  These are questions you need to ask yourself - but I sure as hell want to be known as a fighter.

There are always things in life that we want but are unsure about how to achieve, whether that be an appearance, status, material good, or experience.  I cannot tell you how to get them; however, I do believe that I have a way to help you discover how to get them.  Be honest with yourself in what you are most insecure about, then find a way use that insecurity as the motivator which will drive you towards reaching your goal.

We've all been raised to believe that incentives motivate people.  That placing a carrot at the end of a stick is what really gets someone running.  This is often true, but think about how many "carrots" are at the end of your stick - meanwhile the majority of your time is spent simply staring at the prize or opportunity dangling in front of you.  It is because of this that I've found dis-incentives to be much more powerful motivators.  Because we as humans are exponentially more reactive to fear of loss than the opportunity to gain.  Specifically when it comes to our egos.

Now, how does that relate to motivating oneself using fear and insecurities?  Well, it should not be a novel concept to anyone that your ego is made up of insecurities and fears.  I've never feared being rejected by a girl, I've only ever feared hurting my ego.  The times I've felt insecure around kids who go to more prestigious universities had little to do with where they actually went to school but instead my sense of pride in my own accomplishments - which rattles my ego.  Thus, recognizing this process back in high school I began wondering how I could use it to my advantage.

Like I said in the last post, being honest with yourself is probably the most important thing in life, and I could drown you in great quotes from some of history's most celebrated people asserting so.  In my case, I've never really cared too much about what people think of me in most ways.  I'd shamelessly wear my men's yoga pants when I lived in a frat house simply because I liked them - regardless of the looks I received and rumors they started.  And social suicide or not, when it comes to hobbies or anything I find interesting I dive in.  However, what I **DO** care about is whether or not people take my word seriously.

Keeping promises and following through on my word are the two qualities I value most in myself, and I get completely shaken when I fall through on either.  Even though I constantly find myself being a hypocrite, nothing bugs me more than when others point it out to me.  I have no clue where I developed this deep sense of pride in my own word, but somehow I did, and my fear of someone thinking I'm not good for it is one of my greatest insecurities.  Simply put, my ego is decimated whenever someone doesn't take my promises seriously, or believe what I tell them.  After recognizing this, I found a simple way to use it to help me instead of limit me.

My freshman year of college I wanted to eat much healthier than I had ever before and walk on to BU's D1 crew team.  So to accomplish both these goals, I told literally EVERYONE I met that I only ate salads and was walking on to the crew team (not trying to, but doing it).  Why would I do this?  To put my greatest insecurity on the line.  Now, if a single person saw me eating anything but a salad, or if I didn't make it onto the crew team, people wouldn't take my word seriously - and there wasn't any beast I wouldn't slaughter to prevent that from happening.  Doing so successfully motivated me to push myself to walk on to the crew team, and by the end of the year [no joke] some people simply knew and introduced me as, "the kid who only eats salad".

Your greatest fear or insecurity may be rejection, disappointing your parents, going to hell, or maybe even spiders!  However, the method I've used to motivate me to accomplish most all of the things I've been able to do in my life is that of putting myself in situations where failure to act only results in what I fear most.  When I wanted to learn to cook, I started telling everyone I was a good cook and that we should do dinner together - knowing there was no way in hell I'd not have my ducks in a row by the time that meal came around, and that people were expecting it.  Recognize your greatest fear and find a way to make it the punishment for not pursing the things you are passionate about - it works.
