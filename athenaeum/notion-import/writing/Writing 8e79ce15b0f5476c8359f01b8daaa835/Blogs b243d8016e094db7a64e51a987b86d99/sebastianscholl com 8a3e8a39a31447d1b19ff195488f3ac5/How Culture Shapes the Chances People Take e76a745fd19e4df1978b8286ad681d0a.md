I heard a great observation on Startup the other day. It went something like this:

> “No one at GE remembers back when it was just them and Thomas Edison in their garage making light bulbs”
> 

Now, here's some context.

Startup’s season one episodes are monthly updates from its host, Alex, while building his first company. In a later episode, Alex and his partner are approached by a team from Google interested in helping Gimlet Media - their podcasting company - design and build an app. Following that encounter, Alex wrestles the question of *why* with listeners. “Why did *they* want to help *us*?”.

Alex later alludes to believing the Google employees found some sort of identity in Gimlet. Some of them had been core team member in building products like YouTube and Gmail. So when looking at a young and scrappy Gimlet, maybe they were reminiscent of the “early days”. Back when the colossal products they eventually built we're just a few wireframes explained by a wall swarmed with Post-It notes.

Context, done.

Think of this. At a company like Google, a large number of its employees have been there from day one. Or, to be fair…let’s say day two or three. At a company like GE, no one rightfully owns the origin story. Imagine how much that impacts the company culture. Being the difference in attitude between each company’s employees as influenced by their exposure to innovation, development, and growth, from seed to oak.

The Google folks, I confidently assume, have fantastic salaries and plenty to do. They could simply do their job, as do most, and live ecstatically ever after. Yet maybe that exposure, being apart of an origin story, has shaped them in some way. Maybe from it, their minds are more geared to seeing where things can go rather than where things are. Encouraging them to take bets by lending sweat equity to projects they see promising.

Maybe it's true. That these Googler’s own experiences are what led them to *want* to reach out. If so, it's not far fetched to believe that today's young tech companies experience unprecedented growth because, unlike the titans before them, their employees know first hand what growth looks like.

That said, how is this idea helpful or actionable? I've thought a lot about that in regards to my company, RampEX. What I've distilled is a lesson in team building.

As easy as it is to assume a better salary at a better company is every professional’s goal, the truth is that many people want something more. Especially those people that, at one point or another, had the better salary at the better company. That something extra falls at the cross section of input and impact. The desire to have one's own skills meaningfully shape the outcome of something significant.

These people aren't retirement minded. They are adventurers. Always with an eye open for the next big adventure. To attract them, your idea or company must be that next adventure, both demanding and challenging the skills they’ll bring to the table.

To wrap this up, the importance of *we* is pinnacle when attracting all star team members. When the best talent looks at joining an early stage company, the deciding factor is far more emotional than it is monetary. As a founder, your job boils down to two core tasks. 

They are: 

1) Embodying the adventure with grandiosity.

2) Articulating to the most talented people why only with their skills, effort and hard earned experience will you together accomplish something remarkable.
