During freshmen year at Boston University my closest friends and I had a favorite activity that has yet been matched.  Whenever we had an afternoon to kill or needed an escape, all of us would gather in John's room (my current roommate), turn on the STARZ Original Series Sparticus: Blood and Sand and tip back a few bottles of wine.   Throughout the year, the only changes made to this blissful activity were the snacks we brought; Almonds, grapes, berries, jams, chocolates, crackers and more.  The most popular choice, though, was cheese.

As a joke we started calling ourselves "The Wine & Cheese Club", Boston's most exclusive, prestigious and discriminating organization.  I, of course, took this to the extreme by writing a three page application that was to be given to aspiring members.  Reflecting back on that application, I image a master sommelier would have been stumped.  Additionally, the questions like, "What instrument sounds best when drinking Shiraz? And can you play it?", always delivered an entertaining response.  It was all fun and games back then and the memory that will doubtfully be lost.

It was then that a seed was planted.  The idea of a wine and cheese club was originally a fun joke; however, as my 21st birthday approached I began researching how to start student organizations that would be officially recognized by the university.  As soon as November 16th passed, I started lobbying.  Needless to say, this morning around 11:00am, I received an email from the Boston University Student Activities Office declaring The Boston University Wine & Cheese Society an official student organization.  Now once again it is all fun and games...just a bit more legitimate.

If you are a Boston University student who is of 21 years or older and interested in joining the club, please email me at sscholl@bu.edu or message me on Facebook.  If you would be willing to donate or contribute other resources to the club and help us get up and running, it would be deeply appreciated!

As of now I have an open Facebook group that people can join to learn more about the club and becoming a member.
