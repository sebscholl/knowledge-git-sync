It's hard to tell someone they've been doing something wrong.  Especially when the method they use produces their desired result.  Practically everyone I know can tie their own shoes.  However, only about half of them tie the bow correctly - actually.  It is not a matter of intelligence, but knowing.  You simply have to know.

A week or so ago Dallas, Micky and I had purchased a bunch of bananas to snack on.  They were delicious.  And about half way through I noticed that the stem on Dallas's banana was hanging off the skin that she had peeled back - shocking...I know.  After noticing this I immediately thought to myself, "she doesn't know how to peel a banana?"  Which was a dumb thought - because obviously she had peeled the banana.  However, even though there really isn't a "wrong way" to perform such a task, there is a better way to do it.

Today I'm going to teach you how to properly peel a banana.  And believe it or not, there is a proper way.  It is not by ripping the stem back, but instead pinching the bottom and simply pulling back.  If you've ever seen a cartoon where someone slips on a banana peel, isn't the stem always sticking up in the center?  Yes, yes it is.  Plus, if you use this method, it is much easy to re-cover the banana if you don't want to eat the whole thing.  The reason being that the stem doesn't act like a weight at one end of a peel.

Here is a short video showing you how it's done...this was a silly post...I didn't know what else to write about today.
