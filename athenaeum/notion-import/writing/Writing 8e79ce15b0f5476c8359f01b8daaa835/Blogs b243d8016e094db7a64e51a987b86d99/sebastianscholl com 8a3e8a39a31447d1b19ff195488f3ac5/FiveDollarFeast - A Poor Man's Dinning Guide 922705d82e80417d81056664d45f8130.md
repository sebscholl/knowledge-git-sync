Dear Friends, Family, and Followers,

A new blog was born the other day. I've named it the [Five Dollar Feast](http://www.fivedollarfeast.com/). It's a good blog...and my goal is to have it grow to more than just tantalizing pictures and a magnificently detailed biography about one mans journey to becoming obese. That's not the vision.

This is the vision. That Five Dollar Feast becomes *the* budget dinning guide. A review site and map tool that helps people find great meals to eat for just $5.00. For now the restaurant reviews are simply in NYC and Brooklyn. But wait, oh just you wait! It’s going to become much more fun than just that.  Thank you for your continuing support! My Name’s Sebastian was visited by over 50,000 people last year…and that was pretty much just me talking about my feelings, hah. While I’ll still be contributing to My Name’s Sebastian, your support and involvement in Five Dollar Feast would be ever so helpful. **In the first two weeks over 1,000 people have visited Five Dollar Feast's website, its Instagram photos have received over 1000 favorites, and 150 people have followed @FiveDollarFeast on social media**. And that momentum doesn't need to stop!
