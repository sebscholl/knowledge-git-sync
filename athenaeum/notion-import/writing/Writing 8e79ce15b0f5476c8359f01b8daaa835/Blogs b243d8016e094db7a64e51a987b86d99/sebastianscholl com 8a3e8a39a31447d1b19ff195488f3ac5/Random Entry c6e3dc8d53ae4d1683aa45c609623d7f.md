Bloop. Bloop. Bloop. That's actually the sound in my head. It's dead. Void of anything interesting to say, out think.

I'm choked. So choked up. It's been awhile like this. I've felt, for awhile, like this. Where everytime I write, there's nothing. As this... Is certainly not something.

I'm worried. Extremely worried, actually. That I will amount to nothing. That's not rare, at all. The outcome and the worry. As they play out to become true more often than their more attractive cousins.

Could this be a stage piece? An instillation? The kind of art no one respects but shows up to see because... Fuck it? Could be. Probably. Though why waste the air? That shit is precious.

A man without a plan, and a fair amount of responsibility that he doesn't respect. That's me, for now. Only for now, I hope. As much long, I'd fuck my way out of this hope and blow off everything in the process.

Let's get real. There is a reason why you are "choked up" - or simply feeling cloudy. It's because your compromising, significantly. You're doing things you're neither proud of not respect, which is pulling you down, down, down. Much of it, has to do with her. You know it does. And you won't get out of the fog untill you either abandon ship or fix the leaks. Hopefully, both choices are valid on their own.

I don't get it. I really don't. The pressure she feels comfortable imposing. Her guilty until proven innocent attitude when it comes to me. Where on her side, anything is permissable for a moment of attention.
