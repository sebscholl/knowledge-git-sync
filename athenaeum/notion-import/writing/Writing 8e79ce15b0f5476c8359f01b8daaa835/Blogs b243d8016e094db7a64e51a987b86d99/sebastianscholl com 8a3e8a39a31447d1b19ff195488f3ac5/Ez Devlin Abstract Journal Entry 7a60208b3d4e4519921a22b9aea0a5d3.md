After watching abstract Ez Devlin and Bjorn Ingles episodes

There's a gap that emerges. Not until one has lived through their early adult years, at least. The gap is one between what you imagined yourself being and what you are. It's a gap of skill, imagination, status, and - for some - wealth.

As children, we tend to believe that life is a linear journey towards what we dream of becoming. "All my experiences have made me the person I am", is a mantra of those older. Rarely though is it paired with an admittance of who that person beforehand wanted to be.

The fork in the road seems to only get wider. Straying further and further off away from any path to a desired destination. Becoming more and more content with a version of yourself that's lesser than what you imagined. Allowing the rationalization of "this is what's real" to endow a false sense of maturity and understanding.

Potential is a great lie told to children. Allowing them to believe that something inherent in them will simply manifest as reality. Escaping the responsibility that all of us should grasp, which is to ACT today. Instead, days, weeks, months years slip away as does potential; and only once the socially constructed perception of potential that's so perniciously tied to youth disappears with age do it's constituents realize - or refuse to realize - that never did they actually have anything at all. Other than a misleading believe in an empty promise about themselves.
