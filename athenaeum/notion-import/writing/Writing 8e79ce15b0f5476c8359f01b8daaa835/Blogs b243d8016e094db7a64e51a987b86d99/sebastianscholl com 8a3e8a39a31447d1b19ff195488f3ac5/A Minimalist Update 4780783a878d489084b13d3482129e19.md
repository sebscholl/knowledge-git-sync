Last night I attacked my closet and kept score.  196 was the count...not including socks and underwear.  90% of the clothes were ones I hadn't worn in months, some years, and most of them were even in season!  If I had been filming this whole process I could have been on the next season of Hoarders.  Immediately I ran downstairs to my apartment buildings trash room, found 3 large cardboard boxes, reconstructed them and got to sorting.

......This is not actually my picture

Anything that was a torn, stained or completely worn out, gone.  Any crazy patterns or obnoxious colors, gone.  Anything I hadn't worn in the past 6 months, regardless of if I thought it was cool, gone.  Over the course of two hours, I separated every item of clothing I own into 3 piles; keep, sell and give away.  The sell pile filed up 2 of boxes, the give away pile filled one, and I was left with a total of 46 pieces of clothes (this means I still need to get rid of 16 items).

It was then that I realized, "having to much stuff is hard to keep organized, hard to keep track of, but even harder to get rid of!"  Because to be honest, who wants all my old clothes?  No matter how nice they are... So, to start of the process, I decided to get rid of the giveaway box first.  When I woke up this morning, I quickly got dressed, hoisted the 73lb box (I weighed it) over my shoulder and walked four blocks to GoodWill.

When I'm able to sell the other two boxes, I'll let you know.
