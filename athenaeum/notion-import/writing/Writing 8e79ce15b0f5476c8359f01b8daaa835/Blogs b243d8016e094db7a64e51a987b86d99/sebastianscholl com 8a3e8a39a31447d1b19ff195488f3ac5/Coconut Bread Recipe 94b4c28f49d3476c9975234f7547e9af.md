I've often considered myself an amateur chef, but never a baker (mainly because I don't eat bread..).  The other day though while flipping through my [Paleo](http://paleomagazine.com/) magazine, I saw an advertisement for a gluten free, wheat free, soy free, dairy free and sugar free loaf of coconut bread.  Thinking that I may have finally discovered something baked I would eat, I whipped out my mitts and pre-heated the oven.

You'd think that with everything this recipe is "free" of you'd be baking out of thin air...but this was actually a super simple and easy loaf to bake.  Also, to be honest, the texture was more similar to a cake than a loaf of bread.  Here is the recipe though.

PRE-HEAT OVEN NOW...300 degrees

**Utensils:**

1. 4.5" x 8" Baking Tray
2. 3 Mixing Bowls
3. Whisk
4. Parchment Paper

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup - Extra Smooth Almond Butter (at room temperature)
- 1/4 cup - Almond Milk
- 1/4 cup - Coconut Flour
- 1 teaspoon - Baking Soda
- 1/2 teaspoon - Sea Salt
- 2 1/2 tablespoons - Honey
- 4 - Eggs
- 2 tablespoons - Apple Cider Vinegar
- 1 oz - Coconut Oil

**Steps:**

1) In the first bowl put mix your Extra Smooth Almond Butter with the four egg yolks (separate eggs and save egg whits in separate bowl!).  Mix with whisk until smooth and well mixed consistency.

2) Add Honey, Almond Milk, and Apple Cider Vinegar to the egg and almond butter mix.  Whisk until smooth in color and consistency.

3) In separate bowl mix Coconut Flour, Baking Soda and Sea Salt.  Stir with fork or spoon so that the dry ingredients are well mixed.

4) Whisk egg whites in separate bowl until foamy.

5) Add dry ingredients to the nut butter mixed bowl, and quickly whisk all ingredients in (must complete these last few steps quickly since baking soda is now active!)

6) Re-whisk egg whits till foamy, once foamed add to nut butter and flour mix and whisk till smooth and batter like.

7) Have baking tray lined with parchment paper, then oil the parchment paper with coconut oil (wipe away excess oil with a paper towel

8) Pour batter into the prepped Baking Tray and throw immediately in the oven...DONE

In approximately 40 minutes stick a knife into the loaf and if it comes out clean your coconut loaf is ready.  Pull it out of the oven, let it cool off for an hour or so, then try a slice!

Tip, after putting it in the fridge for a night...for some reason it tasted better the next day.

For the pictures I sliced off a piece and drizzled honey back and forth across the plate, then garnished it with coconut flakes.  Enjoy!
