I’ve been choked up. It’s lasted almost several months now. Whenever a personal experience so greatly contrasts an expectation that was set for you, it’s impossible to not feel conflicted. It's not a question of who was right, but an un-wavering worry about whether you behaved appropriately to have fully grasped that which others expected you to.

It’s a habit of ours to forecast our lives by turning points, or as chapters. Setting specific milestones in the future that symbolize times where we imagine change. Change in ourselves, or change in the way we believe others see us - too often is one confused for the other. This is not bad, but when doing so we without fail dramatize the significance of such events.

It’s not new news that I wasn’t a fan of school. However, as I am in any situation, I wan’t to believe that I had sucked the marrow from the bone. And in reflecting on my past 4-years in Boston, I am not able to confidently say that I have.

The other day I found myself walking past crowds of families whom had just left the Berkeley School of Music commencement ceremony. What I saw mostly were tears.

In what struck me as an impenetrable sense of pride, mothers, fathers, graduates, and others smiled and sobbed. They did so as I watched jealously, confidently predicting that I wouldn’t be even remotely as moved in a weeks time when surrounded by my loved ones with diploma in hand.

An expectation had been fairy-tailed for the sense of accomplishment that a graduating college would give me. And as the hour draws closer and closer, that expectation begins to seem more and more like a fairy-tail - which makes me wonder if I did something wrong.

I’m ecstatic.

It’s amazing that we have the power to set a value for many of our life experiences. Puberty may have well been the last, and only, transition that I didn’t have emotional control over.
