In the famous words of T. Swift, "I'm feeling 22"...but not really.  I feel more like I'm 11, because that's when I started puberty - and lets be honest, the daily frustrations, dreams, and joys never really change after that.

A good friend of my family has a saying, "people never change, they just refine their bullshit".  And on this day I find ever more meaning in his wisdom.

Years ago I wouldn't honestly say that, "I don't know what I want to do when I grow up" - and now that I'm older I say that, "I'm keeping an open mind towards all options in order to maximize my opportunities."  Sounds good, right?  I can only imagine the next cocktail of crap I'll be able to craft over the years to come.

Todays my birthday.  And to be honest, it is one of my least favorite days of the year.  I'm not sure why but I'm always sad on my birthday - no matter what I am doing.

For years I would just spend it by myself.  But over the last two I've had friends (wow, that sounds depressing) who haven't let me pass up a celebration.  So for this year, my two good friends - Ejim and Jake - and I flew out to my favorite city, Budapest, Hungary.

I'm posting this post at 7:24pm, because that was the time I was born 22 years ago.  This post has no real message or meaning behind it...except that I love my mother and am in Budapest.

Love you Mom!
