I’m tempted.

Blame a lack of substance - stimulant or character - as the culprit responsible for damming any articulate creative output. It’s too hard to distinguish whether this is an excuse to get high or a valid gripe. Mind’s are crafty little bastards! They get what they want more than we do.

Yet, nothing matters when nothing’s to show. Even a brilliant justification is worth less than an un-remarkable output; most output. Ideation is adolescences. Potential that, mostly, “matures” into middle management or less.

Squander is of our own doing. Actually, our own lack of doing. Mind’s are crafty little bastards… they get what they want more than we do!
