Something I've always found puzzling is peoples ability and persistence to fabricate connections when there are none.  Or better put, the tendency to impose logic upon things that are illogical.  Constantly I witness attempts to make sense of experiences and happenings.  And constantly I am amused by the connections said to be between, and patterns found  in, things that often have neither.  Because to often do people fool themselves by trying to define the undefinable.

I am in no way wild - though I'm far enough from the median to appear exotic.  This is a statement of mentality, and I only feel comfortable saying it because of my inability to think and act compatibly with most people.  The reason being that while the majority of people I encounter suffer a mental sweat from searching for a method to the madness of life, I prefer the madness.

Spontaneity and randomness are my motivators.  For I'd find no point to living if I knew exactly what to expect.  Even when I have a solid plan, the excitement, whether positive or negative, comes from the unknown possibilities of what could happen along the way - and for those occurrences there is rarely rhyme or reason.

As much as I do have a "connect-the-dots" mentality, I constantly push myself to recognize when there is no picture to be drawn.  To understand and appreciate when the dots are just dots, independent of each other and to be appreciated for what they are, as they are.  For to often in our lives do we fail to fully appreciate, or internalize, one experience due to our tendency to try to connect it with another.

The least happy people I've met are those who are constantly trying to connect the dots - whether that be with relationships, careers, or any experience.  Because by always trying to make these connections, a person gets tired.  And soon they only seek experiences that they already know the meaning of - the familiar.

The most rewarding experiences of my life were either acts or occurrences of spontaneity.  Some had meaning, some meaningless.  Many I've shared with others, an equal amount are to personal to share.  However, only by embracing with enthusiasm the vulnerability of life was I able to experience any of them.
