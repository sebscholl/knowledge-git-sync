June 16th: Tailor made roasting

It's 3 kilos a bucket for their machine, and the roast profiles are proprietary (I think). You are controlling the flame, airflow, and time. Bringing it down from around 200+ degrees to 100 and then back up all the way over 13 or so minutes. At first the bean stays hard and green, giving the roaster more forgiveness in experimentation. After minute three or four though it starts to soften up and needs to climb in Tempuratuer 8 to 10 degrees per minute.

(After roasting each batch the beans are all thrown back into the bag and mixed. Even a few seconds in the roaster can make different tasting notes, so they homogenize the batches for consistency)

FOR HOME USE:

- The tamping effects final product flavor because it changes the density at which the water flows through the grounds.

- towards the last minutes of roasting the roaster smells the coffee every few seconds to judge differences in the roast. A few seconds over 13 minutes, it does make a difference.

- roasting at altitude is best, for the dryer climate, lower humidity, and more tempurate weather makes it easier to control the roast. However, if not in the mountains, it's best to roast at night because of the cooler weather (if you are not sleeping)

Two receipts printer, a ticket and the bill. The bill is rolled up into the small cup and the ticket is used for the order.
