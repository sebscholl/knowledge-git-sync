I’m back.  Back at school, and back to 32 – pieces of clothing that is.  I had let my minimalism slide over the last several months.  Picking up an item here or there thoughtlessly.  And I realized it when flying back from London – my bag wouldn’t close.  So yesterday, before hoisting up my duffle bag, I once again shed belongings.

32 is my number.  Pants, jackets, shirts, shoes, shorts, and so on.  It’s limiting, but plenty - specific, but general.  And even with only 32 items, there is still space for non-essentials…a silver studded sleeveless jacket and one-piece denim jumpsuit are still on my person.

I’m going to share a list of what those items are.  If anyone has ever contemplated what is “essential”, that list will represent the opinion of a 22-year old college student.  The reason behind my 32 is clarity.  Having fewer things to focus on so that my energies can be better employed where I want them.  Being a person whose mental state is easily affected by his environment, the concept of “minimal” helps me stay clean, organized, and calm.

Downsizing is something I encourage to everyone.  Simply, it makes life calmer.  Packing, and unpacking, my suitcase has never been more than a ten-minute affair.  Before it was attributable to carelessness, and now organization.  It has nothing to do with any anti-materialist philosophy of rebellion against consumer society.  It is only a life style choice, with the benefit of eliminating distractions.

I decided to re-downsize right before beginning my last semester in college for a reason.  Now more than ever I need to be clean, organized, and calm, as well as focused.  I feel cliché stating that my dream is to move to New York City – like an old time dancer or actor looking to make it in the “Big City”.  It **is** my dream though, and over the next four months I must find a way to get invited to the party.
