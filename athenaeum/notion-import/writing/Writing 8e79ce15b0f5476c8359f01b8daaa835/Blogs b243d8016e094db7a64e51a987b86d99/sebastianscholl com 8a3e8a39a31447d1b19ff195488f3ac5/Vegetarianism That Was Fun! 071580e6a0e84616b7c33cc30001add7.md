Every since I got back to school from spring break this year I haven't touched meat - that includes fish.  The reason not being because I decided to lessen my eco-footprint or suddenly sided with animal rights activists.  In all honesty, I want to eat a shark just as badly as it wants to eat me.  However, during my transformation towards minimalism I was constantly reading about other prominent minimalists.  Most all of them...are vegetarian, vegans, and some even fruitarians!  This was largely due to ethical beliefs that I couldn't care to think twice about.  At the same time though, I was aspiring to embrace a lifestyle that these people were living, so I thought I might as well give it a go.

At first, I felt GREAT.  Within a month (because I kept up with my same workout routine) I dropped about 15 pounds, I still had great energy levels, and it was fun talking down to my carnivorous friends. I don't know what it is, but when you are a vegetarian you just feel better than everyone else - mentally and physically.  However, after the first month or two I started to notice I couldn't lift as much at the gym, even though I was able to run further, and it was oddly more difficult than usual to get up in the morning.  Thinking that I just wasn't eating enough, I began to include whole grains into my diet, as well as beef up my legume intake.  Nothing changed, though.

As of about 3 weeks ago I nearly crashed.  Regardless of what time I went to sleep it would take an act of god for me to get up before noon, my mind feared the gym like the plague, and all I craved were heavy foods - breads, pastas, meats, ect...  I never let myself eat the pastas or meats, but started to overdose on other breads, eating the whole bread basket at restaurants.  While I started to feel a little bit better after doing so, the weight began to pile back on - I wasn't happy about that.  Thus, it was time to re-evaluate my options.

My Mom gave me some very good advice regarding relationships about a year ago, "when you can see it's going to end, you might as well end it."  After the first month, even though I was enjoying it, I knew that me and vegetarianism were going to break up.  So why not just rip the band aid off now?  Therefore, yesterday I finally made the emotional decision to once again eat meat - starting with fish.  Now (just because the titles are fun) I'm going to most likely stick to being a pescetarian, eating only fish.

This morning for breakfast I prepared my first meat dish after my vegetarian streak for the past 4 or so months.  It was thickly sliced salmon sashimi, wedged between avocado slices, covered in a soy lime and cumin dressing, and garnished with chopped cilantro.  Simply put, it's good to be back.
