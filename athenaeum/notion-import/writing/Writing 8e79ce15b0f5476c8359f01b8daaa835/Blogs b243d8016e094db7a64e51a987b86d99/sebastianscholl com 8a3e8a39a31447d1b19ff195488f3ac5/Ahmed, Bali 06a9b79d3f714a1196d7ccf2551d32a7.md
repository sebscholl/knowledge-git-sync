For the first time while packing, I left my journal back home. It seemed like a good idea at the time. For the past few years I've had nothing to say. So that book has stayed closed. I still have nothing to say. Though I feel like writing.

In all my travelling, never have I seen so many people hand writing journals. All of them are seemingly content doing so as well. Taking time to pause, think, plan, and put pen back to paper. Rarely, if ever, breaking to become distracted by a phone.

Art has become such a prostitute. Artists, and imposters, pimping out every drop of intellectual juice they can squeeze from whatever creative fruits they can find. Whether picked ripen off the highest branch or rotten off the forest floor, no concept is spared. Soon popping up somewhere, by someone, in exchange for a dollar, comment, or like.

Seeing so many journals out makes me happy. Reminding me that unspoiled treasures likely do exist. Some of which are tucked away in the pages of a travelers journal. Only to be discovered, maybe, by another who finds them.
