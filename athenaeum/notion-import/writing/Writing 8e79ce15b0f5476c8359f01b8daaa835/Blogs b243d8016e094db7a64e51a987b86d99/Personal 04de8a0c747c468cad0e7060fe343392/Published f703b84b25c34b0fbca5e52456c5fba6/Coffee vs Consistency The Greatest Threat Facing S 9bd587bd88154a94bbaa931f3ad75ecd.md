# Coffee vs Consistency: The Greatest Threat Facing Specialty Coffee

Two-billion cups are served per day. That’s a lot of coffee. Your idea of “the good stuff” may be the Folgers’ instant coffee powder that you’ve always found in your grandparent’s cupboard. However the experts these days won’t even look at that stuff. Instead their heart jumps at the sight of Kenyan washed coffees, Ethiopian naturals, or Guatemalan single origins.

That may all sound confusing. So here’s a simple way to understand it. Imagine yourself ordering a bottle of wine while at dinner. You wouldn’t just ask for wine. At the very least you’d decide on two characteristics; red, white, or rose and a grape varietal. Most people take it even further by considering a production year, country, specific region, vineyard, plastic cork, natural cork, smell, color… the list goes on.

The same culture of connoisseurship that is status quo in the wine world can now be found in coffee culture. Do you like Robusta or Arabica? Light, medium or dark roast? From Columbia, Rwanda, Indonesia or Costa Rica? As an expresso, pour over, French press, cold brew or cappuccino? And don’t you dare mix in milk, sugar and syrups if it’s brewed coffee. That’s like mixing your wine with soda!

Specialty coffee and boutique specialty coffee are movements that have largely revitalized the stagnant commodity coffee industry that has for a long time shaped the worlds understanding of the beverage.

Quotes on consistency:

“Steam punk is great machine battling consistency. Rather see automation. Nothing the barista can create in the coffee. Once the bean is picked it has its full potential held within the skin. Any touch point after that is simply an opportunity for a person to take a little away.” Joseph
