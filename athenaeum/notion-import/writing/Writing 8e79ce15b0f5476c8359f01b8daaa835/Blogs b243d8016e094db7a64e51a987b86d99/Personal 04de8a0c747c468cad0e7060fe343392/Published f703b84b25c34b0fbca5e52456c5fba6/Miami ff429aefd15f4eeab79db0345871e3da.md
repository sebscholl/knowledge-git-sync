# Miami

More so than anywhere else, Miami indulges itself as once did the Romans. Impulsively satisfying every itch with a surplus of instinctual pleasures. Sex and drugs stretch far beyond Rock & Roll. The entire eclectic cast acting out this cityâ€™s daliesque episodes enjoy privilege. Carelessly living a Groundhog Day of sun, sand, and careless spending.

Miami has money. Money cannot buy class. Miami could care less about class. A fast car and expensive apartment. Our priorities are not in order; to anyone from elsewhere. No one here is trying to order them. Instead we debit against potential using time. Enjoying weekends that never end.
