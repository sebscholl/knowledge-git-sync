**Pro-Life Gunman Threatens to Kill Anyone Who Enters Planned Parenthood**

ATLANTA - Late last Tuesday, Alabama Legislature ratified regulations that will further limit Planned Parenthood’s ability to offer abortion and birth-control services. By only allowing abortions to be legally preformed by out of state doctors in Alabama ER rooms between 6:00pm and 9:00pm on Mondays excluding holidays, the state has once again stepped towards effectively closing the states five abortion clinics.

Though Planned Parenthood’s services remain open to the public, today local person Carol Jackson (22) found herself barred from entering. “At least (two mornings a week ?? a week? ) for the past couple years I’ve visited Planned Parenthood. I’m used to the banter from protestors when walking into the building - Jesus loves you, burn in hell, your child’s heart beats, you have no heart – trust me, I’ve heard it all.” Said Jackson outside the clinic.

Keeping her from entering, though, was pro-life gunman Bill Foster (56). Despite the recent development in legislature limiting abortion services, Foster believes that the state is not acting with necessary decisiveness. Therefore, he stationed himself outside the Piedmont Ave Planned Parenthood clinic earlier this morning, threatening to shoot anyone who enters.

“Life is a gift and people need to stop trying to play God”, preached Foster to a crowd of youths who were being held back by authorities from attempting to enter the clinic. “Every child deserves to be born and loved whether they were conceived intentionally or not, and I will not hesitate to eliminate any of you devils whom dare act otherwise!”

Honestly – I would end it here and make the rest into other articles. This is like the punch line to me. This is where the irony ends and it gets too complicated.

Authorities hoped to detain Foster by asking him to calm down and please talk it out; however, before they could act he was not alone. As the midday sun came, so did yellow school busses filled with elderly protesters from All Saints Catholic Church. Armed with rosaries, crosses and posters detailing the first trimester of child development, these believers quickly gathered around Foster in support.

Tensions quickly escalated as both the young crowd and the old crowd stayed separate and discussed their views amongst themselves. Both parties debated in depth with peers how precisely parallel their views are and concluded that the opposing party was simply too old or too young to understand the oppositions point of view. where the other is coming from.

You are adding too much at the end here – there are three other articles in your last sentence. Also Legislature indicates state wide government and lawmaking, Local Commission, City Commission, and Town Councils are for local ordinances.

Here are some ideas to finish up -

For five hours both parties adamantly held their ground. Nonetheless, soon it was time for the elderly protesters to retire. ( Loading back into their school busses and driving away, )leaving Foster once again alone.

As a result of this incident, the local town counsil decided to take matters into their own hands and have adopted ……(During the demonstration, though, local (Atlanta is in Georgia)Atlanta government had taken the opportunity to hold a public meeting during which legislature) ……- outlawing abortion in the county, criminalizing private gun ownership, and outlawing unpermitted protests( - was adopted.) This allowed the police to immediately take Foster into custody. (Allowing the cops toquickly) put Foster into custody.

Here are some of my ideas for satires followup pieces stemming from this one----

Civil Rights attorneys have taken every available hotel room in this sleepy little southern town in anticipation of the legal fallout from this actione taken by this town counsil. Local attorneys are angry about the big guns muscling in on what they see as their “territory”, but all agree that since the 60’s business has been “slow” and this should provide enough legal fallout to keep everyone “in the money and on TV” for a good while.
