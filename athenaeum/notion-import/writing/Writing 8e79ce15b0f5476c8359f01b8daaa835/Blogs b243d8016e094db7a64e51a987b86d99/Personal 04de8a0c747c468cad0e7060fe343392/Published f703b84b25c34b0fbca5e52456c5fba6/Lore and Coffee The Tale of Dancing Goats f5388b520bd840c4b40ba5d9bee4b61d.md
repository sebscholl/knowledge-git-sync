# Lore and Coffee: The Tale of Dancing Goats

I preferred lore over history. Much like good comedy, the core meaning always feels more honest to me - or less biased. While history is most often dictated by governments, lore is passed down through communities and families. And even though misinterpretation is inevitable in the processes, it is better than propaganda and lies.

The next couple years of my life will be largely focused around one thing; coffee. Where it's grown, how it's grown, how it's processed, how it's shipped, and how it's prepared, are soon to become questions I will be able to answer - along with many other aspects about the commodity.

That knowledge will all be learned in good time. However, the question that I've been focusing on answering now is, "why is it [coffee] important?"

Everything in our world has a creation myth...parularly our world itself. While familiarizing myself with coffee though, I've come across a particularly charming tale of how the commodity was discovered.

I thought I'd share it.

Thousands of years ago, there was an Ethiopian goat herder. His name was Kaldi. His goats roamed freely throughout the day, and returned on their own to his stables at night. On evening though, they did not.

He searched for them during the night. And after hours of searching had finally come across the herd. To his surprise, his goats were all closely gathered and appeared to be dancing vigorously in the moonlight.

He feared that they had been bewitched.

In a slight state of panic, he observed the goats more closely and discovered that they were feasting on a red berried and dark leaved shrub. By this time, the goat herder was quite hungry himself, and a fair bit sleepy. Thus, he decided to throw caution to the wind, and joined his goats in eating the mysterious fruit.

Sometime later, a neighbourhood monk came upon this unique group composed of the goat herder and goats dancing about with unabashed glee. Coming to the same conclusion as the goat herder, the monk decided to bring back some of the berries to the monastery.

Being more scientifically minded then Kaldi or his goats, he conducted various experiments on the berry before trying it out himself. Trying various preparation methods, he particularly enjoyed one combination where he would boil the roasted berries, leaving behind a steaming brew. After a few sips, the monk found that he could now pray long into the night without getting drowsy. So he spread the word about this wonderful drink across Ethiopia, and across the world.
