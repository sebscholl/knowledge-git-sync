# Recovery  and rebound

I’m fucking tired. Nine-months and I’m still thinking about her. Everyone prescribed the same recovery plan; other women. I’m the fool for not taking my meds. The nurses have been turning me away whenever I go to refill the prescription. Apparently the pharmacy doesn’t serve everyone.

It’s nice to think she stole something from me. Then it would be her that would have to give it back. I’d feel justified, believing I’d been wronged. And loiter at her periphery, dreaming of a chance to accept some sappy apology. Just to restore the mess that led me to this low in the first place.

Nothing was stolen. Everything that’s gone, I managed to lose. The confidence, swagger (they are different), charisma, enthusiasm, and of course *her*. I remember being able to capture attention like a goddamn erection in gym shorts. Young, sexual, and standout. I did what I wanted, when I wanted to, wherever I cared to, and thought fuck-all of anyone that demanded otherwise. Yes, I’m being cheeky - but few men would not benefit from added shamelessness.

That *her* part, that’s something I’m now not sure I ever had. Actually I’m sure of it. A person can give themselves to you, but don’t be that sucker that forgets how quickly that gift can be reclaimed. Every romantic gesture we’ve come to know is a ploy. Created to disguise the reality of how little control we have in keeping our super special someone from turning around and fucking the bartender.

The truth is that we’re god awful at closing chapters. Scared of the end. *We*, as in myself and maybe you. Accepting something you don’t believe may seem cowardly, but my god is being able to do so useful. In life and relationships. Hope can be a real bastard, fruitlessly stringing out our energies for already lost objects of fascination. Acceptance enables mobility - socially and emotionally - allowing us to clear our own obstacles and keep course ahead.

I’m guilty of letting my real self die while trying to keep what’s been lost alive in imagination.
