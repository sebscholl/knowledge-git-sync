# Doing what matters, only

To contextualize the title, I promise that this article isn't life-advice or a political statement. If anything, it's about design.

It wasn't until I started my first company that I learned how much time I, and others, spend doing things that don't matter. From in- to de-corporation, I was extremely busy. However, it became clear after a while that my days were getting spent on activities instead of results.

I was doing a lot; little of it mattered.

Let's define "matters". Millions of people - and probably you too - wake up everyday and perform jobs that, we hope, matter. What we're discussing here is what "matters" when there's a job to do, **not** what jobs matter.

Imagine a foodtech startup. Their product is a food reviews app. The founder has a ton on their plate! Engineering needs direction, sales needs leadership, marketing needs research, and HR needs HR stuff. The company definitely needs a system for project management. So, with the resources available, do they buy one or build their own?

I say buy. Why? What the team needs is PM software that works.something that work

Best in the way of better

Arguably, the excercise of building a PM software and maintaining it going forward is not productive towards their end goal; making an awesome food reviews app.

That's a hard reality to contend with. Especially when everyone is diligently doing their job.

The world is getting more friendly towards new **startups**. You will no longer need to spend millions of dollars just to set-up your company. As technology has advanced, you can now do all that at a fraction of the cost.

The number of **startups** in the software sector is larger than any other sector. One of the most basic needs for any software firm is a server to either run its application or even host the platform on.

As technology keeps evolving, it is hard and expensive to always keep your applications updated as per the latest standards. The downtime that results from this is not something your customers would like.

Additionally, many times one would need to re-write the application to keep it updated. This requires a lot of bandwidth which an **early stage start-up** cannot afford to spend. The solution to this problem does exist and many **startups** have already started to move towards this technology.

Let us now see how this technology has helped many **startups** avoid application rewrites.

**Reinventing the wheel with 8base:**

One of the most used **backend-as-a-service** is Firebase. This provides the backend services that are required by many SaaS applications. While this has been a boon to many technology **startups**, it is also a bane at the same time.

The number of application rewrites on this **backend as a service** is very high. Thus, resulting in the downfall of several **early-stage startups**. This is where 8base comes in as the savior.

While both Firebase and 8base offer similar **backend as a service** for SaaS apps, the approach that they use is entirely different. 8base has been designed to reduce the total time that one would spend on application rewrites. With all the changes being pushed to the main app laterally.

Let us now see how 8base does this.

**Reduced Complexity:**

NoSQL databases have a very high potential for rapid development. While the speed of development is very high in this case, the complexity also keeps on increasing as the data increases.

8base avoids this entirely by making use of the auroa MySQL database. This is a relational database and requires a lot of planning for it to be implemented successfully. However, if this initial time is spent then scaling the system, later on, will be a piece of cake.

By reducing the complexity of data one can also reduce the complexity of the various functions that access this data. Hence, by reducing the overall complexity of the app, one can avoid having to rewrite the entire application.

Unlike other **backend as a service**, 8base makes use of **GraphQL** APIâ€™s. This has native support for file/image management, user authentication, and authorization down to the data level. Thus, one would not have to spend too much time designing specific functions.

The whole system is hosted on AWS which is by far the most reputed cloud computing provider. While firebase is hosted on the GCP servers, it does not offer nearly the level of services offered by AWS.

So far we have understood that by reducing the complexity of any application the number of changes that one needs to make to the application also reduces. Let us now understand how does hosting 8base on AWS servers help the cause.

**Benefits of hosting on AWS:**

For the **founders** and engineers, AWS has been the turning point of their **startup**. While there are many cloud computing providers out there, none of them offer the level and quality of service as offered by AWS.

Once you have your backend on the AWS servers, the changes that you would need to make to the application also decreases. Instead of having to rewrite the entire application, you can simply deploy **serverless** functions that are written in typescript or **javascript** onto AWS.

This means that you would need to work on deploying updates as separate functions rather than having to make changes to the main backend. This would also mean that you can remove these changes by removing these **serverless javascript** functions without having to make any changes to the main codebase. Thus, 8base helps to reduce the overall deployment time as well.

Backend updates that would normally take thousands of hours of engineering time can now be saved and used to develop newer features for the service that you are providing. All the countless hours spent by developers as well as the **founders** to push the updates to your system can now be spent on trying to make the product more widely acceptable.

**Impact 8base has on startups:**

Most of the **early stage startups** start their journey by developing a prototype and deploying it for others to use. As the **startup** starts bringing in more customers, the strain it puts on the prototype application is too much and the entire application breaks at the worst possible time.

To adapt to this increasing user base, the app that you developed should be very well designed. However, if this fails, then you will need to redesign the app from scratch. Thus, losing the trust of your new customers at the worst possible time.

Many **startup** **founders** have already started to migrate their platform to 8base. The developers are working on moving their applications to this new service to reduce the overall time that they spend on designing any system from scratch.

By empowering users to make changes with the help of **serverless** function, 8base allows its users to deploy the updates with the least possible downtime. Additionally, bringing the app back to its previous state is also a piece of cake thanks to 8base.

**Conclusion:**

8base has certainly made the life of the **founders** of **technology startups** a whole lot easier. By empowering users to make changes by simple **serverless javascript** functions. By making use of **graphql** API's, the entire backend becomes a whole lot simpler. With less bandwidth spent on app updates and more on adding new features, your **startup** would be on the right path to success.
