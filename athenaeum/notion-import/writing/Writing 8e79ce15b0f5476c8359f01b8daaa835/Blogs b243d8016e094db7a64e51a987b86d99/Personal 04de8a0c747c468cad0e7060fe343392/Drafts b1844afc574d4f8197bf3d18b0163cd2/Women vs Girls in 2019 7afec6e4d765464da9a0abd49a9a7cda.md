# Women vs Girls in 2019

If you don't have anything nice to say, don't saying anything at all. Write it down.

I'm a male. When I was young I was a boy and worked at becoming a man. It didn't happen when I turned 18 or 21. It happened later. No event demarcated the transition. It was a long process.

From what I can tell, most people's idea of what it means to be a man has long been unchanged. Popular opinion on the importance of masculinity has changed. Few people though, if any, would define it in terms other than being self reliant and a provider. That has transcended most culture shifts and preserved a standard for masculinity - a standard that's rooted by having a responsibility to others.

I'm in my late 20's and I'm straight. I've dated, a lot, and been married, once. All of it has led me to being jaded of relationships. I just don't know what to expect from a partner. They all seem to expect me to be a man, but never do they take seriously, or even acknowledged, their responsibility being a women.

Having "woman", and "responsibility" in the same sentence may be considered assault these days. Though what I believe should garner more concern is the fact that todays expectation for boys to grow up and become men is not mirrored for girls to become woman. By some peculiarity, expectations of women are seen as some form of oppression. There perfectly healthy though, and necessary, for men.

I don't know anyone who can articulate what it means to be a woman in 2018. It's seemingly been reduced to having a period and sexual activity, as well as, somehow, any man that considers himself a woman.

I can't say anything about once upon a time, or the way things once were. Wasn't alive then and frankly, the stories sounds somewhat boring. Education, carreers, and everything else men enjoy are things I believe women should (and in the US do) enjoy equal access to. I'm not a mindless mysogonist.

What I am though is concerned that in the push for gender equality, we've stripped all meaning from womanhood - leaving it meaningless. Unlike men, girls don't seem to have a socially respected image to aspire to. They're options are either 1) be like men, or 2) stay girls.
