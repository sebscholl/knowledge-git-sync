# 5 Reasons Why Developers Prefer Building on 8base over Google App Engine

If you are a developer building apps for the web and mobile, working with the right tools can make the difference between meeting your development objectives or getting stuck in the minutia of the back-end. There are now more tools than ever to choose from to take care of the heavy lifting of your app. However, these same tools can add to the complexity of putting everything together. Most developers want to find the most efficient way to get an app launched while creating something ready to scale.

Fortunately, new platforms are putting all the tools in one integrated package. This takes app development to a very different place. Not only are the tools available, now they are accessible in one platform allowing for seamless integration and faster development. Two players in this arena are Google App Engine and 8base. Google's App Engine comes with the distinction of being developed by the internet giant. It certainly brought a new level of integrated tools to the app development space. However, it is not the only option available. 8base takes a new approach, starting from scratch, they created the best possible platform to provide the essential components of an application's infrastructure.

8base is a unique serverless backend-as-a-service platform. It is production-ready and allows javascript developers to build amazing cloud applications using JavaScript and GraphQL. With 8base, developers can focus on the unique aspects of their app while not worrying about the cloud infrastructure. Front-end developers can easily configure and adjust the back-end via the command-line interface using JavaScript and TypeScript.

Developers are already finding the benefits of 8base over Google App Engine. Let's look at some of the reasons.

**1. Production-Ready Workspace**

The whole point of a platform like 8base or Google App Engine is to save time and reduce the number of steps needed to get your app running. Right out of the gate, 8base saves time and frustration by providing a production-ready workspace. You can use the front-end framework of your choice and get minimum viable products up and running fast or get a quicker start on fully-functional enterprise software. Google App Engine, on the other hand, requires a full custom application each time. This adds significant startup time to each and every project.

**2. Native File and Image Support**

If files and images are a part of your application, 8base will save you quite a bit of work since it natively supports file and image storage. App Engine requires extra configuration for this. Either you will need to use Google's Cloud Platform, or choose another 3rd party service and take care of the integration yourself. 8base, on the other hand, offers the back-end services you need. In 8base's Data Viewer, you have full access to the Filestack uploader, which gives you the option of uploading files and images through connected channels like Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, and Google Docs.

**3. One of the World's Most Complete and Powerful GraphQL Engines**

GraphQL, an API-based data query and manipulation language, is really the perfect tool for front-end developers. While Google App Engine can be configured to work with GraphQL, it takes a lot of time and energy to set up. It can be made to work, but App Engine is actually designed for REST APIs. The issue with REST APIs is that they can slow down your app as they require loading data from multiple URLs. GraphQL can retrieve all the data in a single request, saving resources. Using GraphQL also creates a better environment for front-end developers as it doesn't request any special work from back-end developers.

**4. Native Support for Roles and Permissions**

8base natively supports roles and permissions for authorizing data access for client applications. This is all custom implementation work when on Google App Engine. With 8base, there is no longer any need to complete the redundant tasks of implementing roles and permissions for data access. While with Google App Engine, this requires a custom implementation, 8base has a built-in fully identity management solution. It uses an Auth0 account managed by 8base. Not only does using built-in identity management make things easier, but it also decreases the chances of exposing security vulnerabilities. It supports over thirty different single-sign-on methods, including Google, Facebook, and Github.

**5. Straightforward and Transparent Pricing**

Developers working with Google App Engine have quite a bit of guesswork and calculating to understand how much everything is going to cost. In fact, Google offers a complex pricing calculator just to get an estimate of possible costs. 8base makes budgeting easier with straightforward and transparent pricing. You know precisely what you are spending upfront. And, should you need to scale up, it is simple to figure the increase in pricing.
