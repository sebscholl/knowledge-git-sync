# Only doing what matters

To not let the title mislead you, I promise that this article isn't life-advice or a political statement. If anything, it is about design.

It wasn't until I started a company that I learned how much time I, and others, spend doing things that don't matter. From incorporation to un-incorporation, I felt swamped. However, it became clear after a while that my days were getting spent partaking in activities instead of producing results.

I was doing a lot; little of it mattered.

Millions of people - and probably you too - wake up every day and perform jobs that, we all hope, matter. What we're discussing now is what matters when there's a job to do, **not** which jobs matter.

## The Example(s)

Let's imagine a startup, Fewdy, whose product is a food app. The founder, Sara, has a ton on her plate - dining pun! Engineering needs direction, and Sales needs leadership, Marketing needs research and HR needs... HR stuff. To best manage everything, she wants a project management system in place.

So, with the resources available, does she buy or build?

The reason Sara assembled her team in the first place is to create a food app; not PM software. It isn't a question of whether or not they're capable! It's that focusing on anything that isn't food app related is a distraction, regardless of whether it supports their efforts. What Fewdy needs is a solution that *works for them* instead of one *they work for*. So, with this in mind, Sara decides, "*buy.*"

Maybe this last example was too obvious. It's 2019, and most professionals are quick to buy systems rather than build them. It's wild to imagine Fewdy's marketing leader approaching engineering with a marketing automation platform spec instead of approach MailChimp with a credit card!

Let's dive a little deeper with a less obvious example.

Fewdy's engineering team is ready to begin developing the new app. They've diligently planned everything so that it gets handled in byte-sized chunks - **META FOOD PUN**! Some of those chunks include a data API, database, authentication/authorization system, sleek interfaces, and more. Once all these puzzle pieces fall into place, Fewdy will have an app!

So, with the resources available, which puzzle pieces do they buy or build? Well, let's do an acid test; *where's the* *plumbing*?

Plumbing is something that people only care about if it's **not** working - and don't think twice about when it is! Metaphorically, almost everything has plumbing, Fewdy's app included. Also (not-metaphorically), the less plumbing you're responsible for, the less crap you have to touch.

For example, the app's users will only care about Fewdy's authentication system when it's hacked, and all their information ends up on the dark web. The app's interface and content quality, on the other hand, will consistently impact peoples' choice of whether to use Fewdy. Are both pieces important? Yes! However, which is functional as opposed to being unique and differentiating?

Once again, Fewdy's engineering team is fully capable of building an authentication infrastructure. That said, time spent on plumbing is the time **not** spent on what *matters*; performance, interface, and reviews content. So, with authentication in mind, Sara decides, "*buy.*"

Let's dive so, so slightly deeper with one last example.

When Sara told the CTO, Jake, to go buy an authentication system, Jake said, "*Nah.*" Without mentioning it to Sara and the rest of the company, he went ahead and built a fully-fledged authentication system. Not only that, he did an incredible job. Even when Sara finds out, she can't help herself from being overwhelmed by a sublime sense of awe. It's simply beautiful.

In the meantime, Sara is struggling with Fewdy. Investors are telling her that the food-tech space is too saturated for their appetite - health food pun! However, the last few VC's she spoke with are bullish on both Developer Tools and Software as a Service (SaaS). Knowing this, and still fawning over Jake's authentication system, she makes an executive announcement during the next all-hands meeting.

"Pivot! Fewdy is now an Authentication as a Service (AaaS) company."

What's this mean for the company? It means that what's *meaningful* has fundamentally changed. While Fewdy's auth system will now end up being their new customer's *plumbing,* it's now their unique differentiator.

So the authentication puzzle piece has now evolved into Fewdy's product, and Sara says, "*build!*"

## The Insight

Whether you're at a resource-strapped startup or money bleeding megacorp, it's essential to learn to delegate the non-unique parts of your work to people that uniquely handle those part. If you don't, most of your time will probably get spent doing things that don't matter.

Services wise, we're in a pretty fantastic era. There's almost nothing in which someone or some company doesn't specialize. What does this mean for entrepreneurs and team leaders? It means that they can accomplish more substantial and complicated projects, without having to own the *plumbing (*non-unique parts). Instead, they can count on specialized services to bring in the pipes - often achieving a better result than had they not.

## The Conclusion

After my entrepreneurial stint, I joined a pretty fantastic company called [8base](about:blank). In short, we provide the *plumbing* to entrepreneurs and teams building software apps that need to scale. All the application puzzles pieces that aren't uniquely differentiating are ones we differentiate ourselves by uniquely doing.

In my role, I'm continually getting to meet and talk to talented people working on awesome projects. It's been an education that's helped me internalize just how collaborative of a process building *anything* is. So many people and parts have to come together, both from within and outside. Making sure that each one of those pieces gets handled by someone whose best interest is handling that piece, is mission-critical!
