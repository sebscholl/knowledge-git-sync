# Larry the Love Monkey

Larry the love monkey

Was a primate who

Gave all of his love

To those at the zoo

He'd kiss and hug

and always act nice

And only every dreamed

That someday he'd find

Another love monkey

Just like him

He want a hug and kiss

Whenever he did.

Though until he does

He'll stick to his ways

Spreading his love

To all his zoo friends
