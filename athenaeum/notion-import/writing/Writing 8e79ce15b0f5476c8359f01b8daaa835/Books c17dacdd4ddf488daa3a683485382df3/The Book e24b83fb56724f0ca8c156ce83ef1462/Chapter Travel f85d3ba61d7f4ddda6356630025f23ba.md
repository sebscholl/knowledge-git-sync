Intimacy of Travel

There is a certain level of uncertainty associated with any strong opinion that can only be alleviated when reaffirmed by others. Whenever I am too excited about something, I’m equally timid to share my enthusiasm. Out of uncertainty on whether or not I judged an experience in a way that others would find equal meaning from.

I say this because I am now back in Budapest and both Dallas and Micky have become equally captured by the city as me. And them feeling so has made it even more attractive to me. It is beautiful, clean, affordable, cultural, and fun – but most of all unique. A place where a gem is hidden on every street. The outdoor bars and restaurants give of a trendy and rugged impression, making a person feel as though they are apart of a scene. It is very, very cool here.

While on our train to Budapest from Split I began thinking about how intimate of an experience travel is. And that what’s learned about a persons true being after months of dating can more effectively be learned after only a week of travel. On the road there is little or no privacy. And a sense of adventurism that encourages a person to give up more of them-self than commonly made public. It’s because travelers must trust one another – and the most common way to test someone’s trust worthiness is to confide in them.

The value I find most in travel is not the destination, it’s while in transit. Those long hours where I may stare out of a train, plane, or automobile window with little more company than my own opaque reflection. Staring back at me as aimlessly as I at it. It is during that down time, where I’m able to travel by both body and mind, that I cherish my privilege the most.

When in such situations amongst others it seems nearly impossible to avoid such introspective dialogues. Everyone trying to not seem overly eager to share secrets about themselves, but willingly do so in exchange for those of others. It’s a voyeuristic game in which participants play with each other but against themselves. And slowly chip away at their inner wall that protects both ego and self-image.

Looking back over my trip I split it into two periods; a solo period and an accompanied period. Both are absolutely unique and valuable experiences. And between the two I could not choose one. Because I believe it is equally important to have time to learn about yourself as it is to learn about others. And there infinite lessons to be learned in both situations.

[Spending too much can make you see too little](http://mynamessebastian.com/budget-travel-how-spending-too-much-can-make-you-see-too-little/)

I first experienced budget travel as an eight year old. Mom felt like taking a road trip, so over the next eight months my siblings and I ended up living out of a white chevy suburban. I’m not sure if it was out of necessity, or part of a greater plan to impose upon us kids a frugal mentality. One or the other, over the course of that trip I recall us spending what seemed to be very little money.

I stuck with low budget travel during my teen years without being aware of it – likely because it was all I had been exposed to. Aside from family influence, the communities I was attracted to were made up mostly of extreme athletes who lacked the resources needed to travel in “style” – so I played along.

My family could have, if they wanted to, afforded me a more fashionable level luxury on my trips. But they never did offer, nor did I ask – they were often the ones pushing me to go further into the bush.

Let me make clear that I categorize travel and vacation very separately. A person assumes a completely different mindset when on vacation than the mindset that is necessary for travel. Travel, when done properly, demands a certain level of alertness that vacation does not. When traveling, a person must be reactive.

I’m going to suggest that there is a much greater value to be gained from low budget travel than simply saving a few bucks, as well as encourage people who don’t have strict financial constraints to at least attempt at having a low budget travel experience. I don’t claim myself to be some sort of travel expert. Yes, I have traveled on what I see as a low budget – though I’ve often encountered others who seem to do it with more conviction and result. However, the following is an opinion I can support from taking such trips, and I hope that my thoughts resonate with the wanderlust that lives somewhere inside you.

Interestingly, too much money is often as preventative to a person having an authentic and meaningful travel experience as is too little money. It’s easy to see why too little money is limiting. But how is too much money limiting in travel? Wouldn’t it allow you to do more?

Truly authentic and cultural experiences (at least the ones I’ve come to value) aren’t those with price tags. By *cultural* I do not mean eating grilled beef kebabs at a Jamaican resort while some Guatemalan guy spits fire and a chorus of Kenyan men smile and slap drums. Immersing oneself into a community is crucial to really experiencing its culture. And immersion cannot be accomplished by looking through a hotel window, but only by engaging in the very same activities that the people in that culture can afford to do.

I promise you, the majority of people in most cultures do not have big budgets – meaning that anything your big budget enables you to do is definitely not something that the locals are dedicating their leisure time to.

When you give yourself too large of a budget, you’re always focused on what that budget, or lack of one, will be able to afford. Instead of taking a chance on a hole in the wall eatery, you’ll choose a restaurant with the menu in six-languages. Instead of a hostel, BnB, couch, or other accommodation that forces you in with locals, you’ll book the Four Seasons. And by doing so you allow your budget to effectively distance you from the very culture you traveled to experience.

It’s a psychologic shift. A different way of thinking. If I were to hand you a thick stack of cash and say have fun, you’d ask yourself, “what are all the things I can get **with** this money?” The shift that comes when you start thinking low budget is, “what are all the things I can do **without**, or just **a little** of, this money?”

On a side note, we become passive when we pay for something – especially at the premiums which tourists pay – because we feel that we’ve done our part at that point. Just like on a vacation, you expect everything to be taken care of after you’ve paid the resort. Having that passive mentality will inhibit you from ever discovering most of what the world has to offer – not just in travel.

Almost all experiences do have financial elements to them. Whether you’re going to Couchsurf your way through South Africa or fish for all your food in Indonesia, a plane, boat, or bus ticket will need to be purchased, as well as other expenses incurred along the way. It is important though that you **never** allow that financial element to limit your vision to only those experiences it plays a role in.

So, in as few words as possible, here is the core lesson that I believe can be internalized from low budget travel (when combined with an adventurous spirit).

*“Never let money limit your experiences only to those that money can buy"* 

# Where the Wild Things Are

There is a high likelihood that we – college educated adults – will have the opportunity during our lives to visit several of the world’s great cities. A business trip, family vacation, honeymoon or divorce getaway, midlife crisis or happy retirement – a majority of us will travel to foreign destinations. Standing beneath the Eiffel tower, drifting Venice by Gondola, or walking the Berlin Wall are no longer “once in a lifetime” opportunities as the challenge to create the most unique “bucket lists” becomes high fashion.

“Why do I travel?” is a question that I perpetually ponder. The common answers comprise a collage of clichés, mostly proffered up by travel salespersons to those people who don’t seek a tangible meaning to the activities they pursue. In the high school and college years, one is encouraged to travel “to become cultured”, “to become worldly”, “to discover themselves”, “find new experiences”, “gain new perspectives” – all these generic purposes are widely accepted and easily found in bulk on study abroad pamphlets.

The cliché motives for travel I deemed generic above are, ironically, also the ones I believe to be true. There have been no contributions to my education more meaningful than those experiences I have had traveling. I firmly believe there are no substitutes for first hand experience, and I apply that belief to all aspects of life. Travel gives a person the opportunity to discover new and vastly different realities from his or her own. And once internalized, hopefully, they’ll be better equipped to relate to others, communicate, and construct a more panoptic prism through which they will see and understand how the world operates.

Ideally, travel incubates more holistic and capable people. Ones who develop a greater capacity for empathy and appreciation, advanced social skills, as well as strong decision-making skills. But does it? And, more specifically, how does studying abroad assist a student in achieving such betterments?

My current home is London, along with approximately three hundred other American students on study abroad through Boston University. More so than other popular study abroad destinations, London is thought of as, “a launch point for the rest of Europe”. As far as I’ve observed, few come to London for the cultural experience. The students here are often falling asleep in class, too tired to stay awake after spending whole nights researching flight and train deals. Unlike the US, a dormitory security guard’s job is a breeze over the weekend. The reason being that most students scatter off to the airports and train stations as soon as classes surcease for the week.

Where do we go? Paris, Berlin, Copenhagen, Rome, Venice, Zurich, Madrid, Amsterdam, the list goes on. With cheap flights being offered by budget airlines such as Ryan Air and Easy Jet, a round trip flight to mainland Europe can often cost less than purchasing a new T-shirt in London (not even a designer brand). In some cases, for less than £75 a head, groups of friends can catch a plane to most any European country for a weekend excursion. It is an invaluable privilege for us students participating because for the first time in history we are enjoying international travel as an affordable reality. However, what about the promised benefits of travel? The supposed gains bestowed upon the traveler? Can a person endure such travel experiences and gain the desired growth and wisdom when very little challenge or adversity is involved?

In the contemporary world, internationalism and multiculturalism have become creed to modern culture. Globalism is the goal, but homogenization is the unhappy result. In effect, my experiences in New York, Boston, or hometown of Miami differ very little from time spent in any of the world’s metropolises. Simply put, when I now visit major world cities, the world feels flat.

For the leisure traveler, this reality is un-alarming – maybe even exciting. No matter where a person travels to, as long as a star accompanies the name on maps, they are nearly guaranteed to find familiar luxuries, familiar people, and causally enjoy cultural relics at their leisure. My only hope is that such people are simply trying to kick start their travel engines, and their desire to really explore our world will be primed by such trips. However, for those who seek adventure, and more for their time and money, such destinations provide scant fulfillment and thwart the purpose.

While crossing the English Channel this past Sunday after spending a weekend in Paris, I once again was asking myself, “Why do I travel?” My weekend in Paris was spent at bars, restaurants, and clubs that served international cuisine to the beat of American music. My attempts to see Paris were spent fighting my way through tourist mobs at historical sights. The prominent retail district was lined with stores that may easily be found all over the planet. And as a result, my “Parisian experience” differed very little from my experiences in any other major world city. With the exception, of course, that the Parisians are unique in their rudeness.

I’m not saying a person cannot find and enjoy an authentic French experience such as a Parisian café; however, at this point in my travels, I’ve found that the charm of any authentic experience is severely diminished when my view includes a Starbucks across the street.

So, here I am approaching the White Cliffs of Dover, on my return trip to London, where I will likely spend the next week planning yet another trip. And I find myself thinking back on my various travel memories, and notice an obvious and common thread that has companioned every meaningful experience. These were the character building experiences, the memorable and life changing situations endured, the frightening and blissful moments shared with others, the treasures found while aimlessly wandering, the partners and friends acquired on the road, the hardships overcome and seemingly impossible feats conquered in the process – these are the adventures I will tell as **MY** stories for the rest of my life.

What was that common thread? It was when comfort, familiarity, and often safety, were of the least concern. Living with Tibetan monks in the Sichuan Valley of Tibet, road tripping the Dalmatian coast, catching sheruits in the middle of the night to Jerusalem, budget traveling by train through mainland Europe, kayaking off waterfalls along the United State’s west coast, hiking in the Swiss Alps, screaming into the mysteriously vast emptiness of the Scottish Highlands, whole nights spent romantically with strangers on Cycladic Island Beaches, and night climbing the Smokey Mountain’s sheer cliffs to witness a sunrise 1000 feet off the ground – these were the times that are imprinted in my memory and heart. They are the experiences that, in retrospect, I can attribute much of my personal growth to. Most importantly though, they are the stories I will remember, and the ones I will share.

Despite my strong bias, there is nothing wrong with large cities or being a leisure traveler. Having visited many major cities has provided both entertaining and educational experiences that in no way do I regret having. However, I find old wisdom such as *what you put into something is what you get out of it* to appropriately apply to making travel meaningful. And, in effect, when you commit to taking easy trips, the value of the experience may very well be equal to the trouble encountered when swiping your credit card – or worse, having to enter your card number manually.

If the words above tinder even the slightest spark in your adventurous spirit, I deeply recommend that you fan the fire.

Even though the world is fully mapped, there are still more destination that have yet to become tourist destinations. Places of jaw dropping beauty that operate true to themselves and their environment, places where true adventure awaits you – places, where the wild things are.

**Resources to Check Out:**

– **Airline Companies:** There are many airlines offering amazing ticket prices (for both last minute and early bookers). The following are a few of my favorites:

[www.ryanair.com](http://www.ryanair.com/)

[www.easyjet.com](http://www.easyjet.com/)

[www.wizzair.com](http://www.wizzair.com/)

– **Search Sights:** For flights I’ve found [Edreams.net](http://edreams.net/) and [Skyscanner.net](http://skyscanner.net/) to be the best search engines. The most unique feature of Skyscanner is that you can search flights without a destination in mind! Just type in your departure city, “everywhere” for a destination, and a list ordered by price will appear to reveal where you can go.

– **Trains:** Most private train companies have their own sites, but they are poorly updated and not easily understood. [Www.Raildude.com](http://www.raildude.com/) does a good job of explaining train timetables – however, there are few things more fun or exciting than just showing up to a station and asking for “the next train to…”

– **Boats and Ferry’s:** I do not have any specific resources for sea travel. Each part of the world that offers ferry travel has their own region specific (and often terrible organized) resources. I felt obliged to mention it though, because maritime travel is still an affordable and exciting option, and in many cases the **only** way to reach certain parts of the world.

– **Accommodations:** Every rumor Americans have heard about hostels is wrong. Simple as that. Hostels are affordable accommodations where travelers meet new people, can partake in local social events, and have a blast. [Www.hostelbookers.com](http://www.hostelbookers.com/) is a great resource for finding hostels. However, if you are traveling with a group and want a more private experience, check out [www.airbnb.com](http://www.airbnb.com/)

– **Alternative Accommodations:** If you are more adventurous and interested in free housing, take some time to explore [www.couchsurfing.com](http://www.couchsurfing.com/). In short it is a global network, on which people allow travelers to stay in their homes free of charge. It also hosts social events and meet-ups in most of the world’s towns and cities – most of which are also free of charge.

– And lastly, if you simply can’t imagine where in the world you would go besides major destinations, go to [www.stumbleupon.com](http://www.stumbleupon.com/) and “stumble” photography and travel. The pictures and experiences I’ve come across by doing this have truthfully inspired many of the trips I’ve taken, and will be taking.
