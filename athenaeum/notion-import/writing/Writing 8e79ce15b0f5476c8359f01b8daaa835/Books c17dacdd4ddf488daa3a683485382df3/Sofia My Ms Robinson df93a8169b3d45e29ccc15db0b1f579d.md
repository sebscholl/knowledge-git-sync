# Sofia: My Ms. Robinson

Preface:

I’ve not read enough books to understand what makes a good preface. Honestly, I can’t really conceptualize the point of one. Whenever a great story has been told to me, the owner jumped right to it. All credits mentioned afterwards. So now, when writing my own, I’m urged to make it whatever I care to.

I’m not very excited about the way I imagine it turning out.

This is going to be an explanation. Not an apology. As once said in a great movie, “despite my privileged upbringing I’ve turned out quite balanced - having a chip on both shoulders.” Having seen so much of the world at a young age, I hold a very cynical opinion of it. Ones youth, as I’ve been influenced to hope, is a time to be blinded by optimism. For whatever reason, that mindset has never come to me authentically. That fact greatly worries me. As I believe cynicism grows with age, which will no doubt lead to a torturous existence. So many of the activities we indulge in, like writing, are only to distract from that.

Much of what I’m going to write about, if it ever gets read by anyone, may no doubt be labeled misogynistic, macho, conservative, selfish, egotistical, oppressive, and maybe even pathetic. There will definitely be some old worldness to it. However, we live in a time where the floor is just so littered with egg-shells a person is expected to stand in place. I rather take a gun to the head then obliged such obedience. Especially so mindlessly to whatever creed is currently walking the runway.

Something to keep in mind while you read this is that I believe I’m right. Surely as I live, grow, and further experience the world, my beliefs will too. When they do, I will still believe that I am right. Such an attitude demands for a level of conviction and pride that has become seemingly unfashionable these days. Though there’s no doubt that it is such an attitude that makes the people who embody it extraordinary. For most people’s beliefs and opinions simply mirror those around them too much to be considered serious.

Philosphy is an art of self flattery and bull shit. Human imagination has such a skill for forgetfulness. Forgetting that their is soil beneath our feet, instinct in our being, and all the other realities that academia gives so little attention to. I say this because this book should never be considered a book of my personal philosophy. I’m not an idealist. Such literature is too often the product of mental masterbation, concieved in isolation to tell not of what the world is, but how a hermit thinks it should be.

Instead, as to make this as humanly as possible, it’s going to be a true love story. Sadly, we are predispositioned to assume a happy ending. However, that is relative, because throughout the course of this book you may very well come to hate me or love me. Depending on that outcome, you may find happiness in my sorrow or come to share it. I guess, when the ink has dried and blank page is turned, that will determine whether or not this story has a happy ending.

The reason I share this is to reflect. And in do so reflect honestly - as I do not believe in lying. If I’m to share something with the world, I commit myself to making sure it is true - as best as I can see what is each truth. Throughout this love, I made many decisions. And woven into it’s chronology of events that are so meaningful to my character, I believe it important to explain the motives behind those decisions. Such as why I exhausted myself fighting for something while ignoring the advice of those I love and admire, which was a group that regrettably included the girl I was fighting for.

The hostel is about one hour and fifteen minutes South West of Shanghai’s Bund. Even though it was my third visit, I remember neither the name or address. All that has stuck with me is the dread I’d experience before each trip. Knowing that I would soon be welcomed to the industrial hell that characterizes so much of modern China.

I’d been to China before on more than several occasions. On a backpacking trip when I was fifteen I hiked through Tibet to go build an orphanage in the Shechen Valley. Such trips are often taken to provide fodder for application essays to top universities. Surely, companions on my trip were definitely present by such motives. Despite a few hours spent actually blistering our hands constructing a roof, wall or doorway, the majority of our time was spent playing frisbee with orphans or indulging in our own recreation. Our obligation during the time was to ourselves. For while we imagined our motive was to make some difference, never were we willing to put ourselves through the discomfort or sacrifice needed to do so.

With the main house at the northern end of a fully enclosed courtyard, that orphanage existed in isolation of a flat valley in the Tibetan mountains. Entirely enclosed by a two-meter cement block wall, the orphans lives existed within such visible boundaries - both physically and socially. In retrospect, my groups presence must have been a disturbance of the worst sort. Being that in such an environment, our influence did not liberate, but provide an awareness of the world which those children will never experience.

Halfway into our stay at the orphanage, I remember hearing screams. It was early in the afternoon, and the shrieks were unmistakably crying for help. Myself and several others rushed out of our room. And just outside were greeted by three organized lines of young children, no older than five or six. Their hands were held straight out in front of them. Palms open towards the sky. Walking slowly along each row was a bald and frail looking man, holding behind him a splintered piece of wood that was the length of an average ruler. Along his path, at leisure, he’d speak to one of the children. More often than not, soon after their response, he’d lift the club up in front of him and bring it crashing down upon their open palms.

He was their math teacher.

I was young myself, and stood there petrified. Little did I know that what I was witnessing was in no way a disciplinary session, but schooling. Undoubtedly, the language barrier supported such misunderstanding. However, as we later came to understand, the teacher was a Chinese man who punished a incorrect answer to proposed math problems with scarred hands. The owner of the orphanage, a good man, very simply explained that there were no other teachers around. It was either him, or no education.

What I remember most vividly are the orphans who had not been swatted picking splinters out of other’s hands. Seeing them wipe other’s blood off on their clothes while navigating the wood shrapnel that was implanted with each wrong answer. They helped their brothers and sisters next to them while I stood their stoopified.

It wasn’t too long until I demanded we stop this. My translator, and the guides on my trip, ordered that doing so was not my place. Regrettably, I obeyed. And to this day, I feel as a coward for having not marched forward and done to that teacher's head the same as he did to his students hands.

Much of my anger towards China and the Chinese people stems from that one individual - the math teacher. As time and time again have I seen similar brutality and pervertedness exuded from the Chinese people. Almost no respect or value is given to human life by them. And at an impressionable age myself, experiencing so led me to believe the frailty of regard. Meaning that none of the rights we believe we have are in fact inherent, but fought for. My freedom of thought, expression, and belief was earned by men and women much greater than myself. Excuse me for the tangent. I often get carried away.

The hostel provided a computer without internet and a mattress made of wood. With truth, there was no mattress, simply a sheet of plywood on top of which linens were laid. The reason I had landed here was business. Well, in somewhat of a contrived way. At the time I was interning for a coffee company and - frankly - both my boss and my time was often spent simply looking for something to keep me busy. With our main distributor working out of this decrepit corner of Shanghai, we concluded that my time would be well spent taking classes at their facility. All of which were, naturally, in Chinese.

Sleep didn’t come naturally to me in such an environment. When not in class, my time was mostly spent staring deep into the ceiling, over hearing whores working in the next door rooms, as listening to my stomach complain about subsisting on nothing other than instant Ramen. Laying there, I remember thinking that the only way this could have come about was simply by others deciding what was best for me. I’d allowed my insecurities concerning career to pass the burden of decision to others. And thank to doing so, I was sleeping on plywood in bum-fuck China.

Even the people that care for you most rarely have your best interest at heart. It’s against our nature.

-----------------------------------------------

Now, why am I telling you this? So that you may begin to understand that drives me. In the preface, I mentioned I don’t believe in lying. Well, fuck that if I’m unable to prove it through example and action. The love story I promised is to come. But in order to give that story meaning, you’ll have to know me - you’ll have to understand me. And I am not defined by my beliefs, but my behaviors.

On the last evening of the trip I was spent. It had been my 5th trip to China, and contributed more to my distaste for the country than the collective experiences prior. None the less, young and anxious, and choose to seek out adventure or trouble, and took the first step by booking a hotel room downtown for my last night of the trip.

For those less traveled, scams and set ups may be believed to be oddities. Truthfully however, they are as common and recognizable as infomercials. We are simple people at the end of the day. It doesn’t require any brilliance to take advantage of others. As I said, I was looking for adventure or trouble that night. The only compliment I can give myself for that night was on my ability to find both.

After washing up in the hotel, I headed off to a popular area of town for Americans. In my mind, it is characterized by the large Cartier store that shadows a long strip of restaurants and bars. One of those bars is a German beer hall that provides a familiar comfort to those visiting from the west. Every man in the venue was loosening their ties while visiting on business. Every woman in the venue was working.

I had two beers before leaving. During that time, a half dozen or so girls had approached me to offer their services. They came in a variety that most buffets cannot even offer. Though at that time, I said no.

She was suggested to me, as unflatteringly as that sounds. After moving to New York for a job with a coffee company, my co-workers were accommodating and put in effort to help me feel at home. One of them, a few weeks in, asked somewhat of a rhetorical question. “Do you like tall blonds?” I don’t remember my response. It most likely was only a smirk. He continued though, telling me about this girl who supposedly ran the company's public relations efforts. After a few favorable anecdotes I asked how old she was. “Early thirties”, he said, and I laughed. I was only twenty-three, living with five roommates in a one bathroom warehouse, and three-weeks into my move to New York. That interaction left no impression on me other than her name - Sofia.
