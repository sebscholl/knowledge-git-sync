# Forget about time for awhile

Sometimes I feel like
Someone left my brain on
And it's so tired
After working so long

So it seems like
It's right to turn it off

Cause tonight
It's time to forget about time for awhile

Hum hum hummm

At some point it restarts
Guess it wants to be on
But the way that it was off
Was time to forget about time for awhile
