V1:
She sits alone in her car
Crying, torturing herself
Fabricating doubts on all the
Things her heart once knew
About a boy that she's loves
But sadly, as that love grew
She got scared.
Love makes you scared.

V2:
Her doubts became a snowball
That so quickly grew
Into something bigger that
What she could see through.
Destroying everything in it's path
That could lead to happiness
As that's what doubt will do
Yeah that's what doubt will do.

Chorus:
Tell me, why
We get scared when we find
Someone
Who makes us feel alive
This time
I've got to forgive myself
As she
Played sabatoge by herself

V3:
The hopes and dreams and future
that they once had planned to do.
Vanished in an instant, as soon as
Her message came through, that said
How she wanted to break this, and
give her self some time and space
to figure what she's going through.
Yeah, figure out what shes going through.

V4:
At one point he was certain, that
With her they could make it through.
Any of the shit that life could
Try to put them through, but then she
Pushed him out from inside, as her
snowball grew and grew.
Her snowball grew and grew.

(Intense transition)
Why couldn't it have crumbled.
D
Instead of me and you.

Chorus:
G

Tell me
Why we get scared when we find
Someone
Who makes us feel alive
This time
I've got to forgive myself
As she
Played sabatoge by herself

Outro:
I broke down on the sidelines, as I
Saw her fighting inside
Sabatoge came as a surprise
Pray her snowball melts with time.

Yeah I broke down on the sidelines, as I
Saw her fighting inside
Sabatoge came as a surprise
I pray her snowball will melt with time.
