Verse 1:

All of my friends

Have someone to hold

Someone who's there

For nights when it's cold

They always have fun

And something to do

While I tag along

Trying to look cool

It's too bad that I

Am not interested

Unless a girl

Is over a 10

So I sit beside

Happy pairs of 2

And sorely stand out

Alone in the room

Chorus:

I wish that I

Wasn't third wheel

And had a girl

To take out to meals

Brandon is cool

And Mona is great

To bad my left hand

Is my only date

Verse:

When I was a boy

I was never alone

I always had friends

To take out or take home

So I never learned

To be by myself

That's why I freak out

When no one's around

I miss my friend

Sebastian

Even though he's

Kind of depressive

Maybe it's time

I find something to do

Like get totally ripped

Or learn to do Kung Fu

But until then

I'm alone by myself

IÂ know Brandon's right here

But he doesn't count

Chorus:

I wish that I

Wasn't third wheel

And had a girl

To take out to meals

Brandon is cool

And Mona is great

To bad my left hand

Is my only date
