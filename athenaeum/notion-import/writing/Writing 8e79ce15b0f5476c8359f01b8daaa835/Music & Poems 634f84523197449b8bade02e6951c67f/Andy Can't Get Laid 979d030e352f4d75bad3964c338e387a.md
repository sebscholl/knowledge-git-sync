"Andy Can't Get Laid"

Hanging on hibiscus
With a few new kids
It was a Wednesday
Before a holiday

I saw a cute chick
Her accent was British
So we started talking
About our upbringing

When I wasn't looking
A new kid got angry
So he got to texting
The others his feelings

So they all got angry
That I was cock blocking
Just by talking
To a girl he was digging

And that's when he told me
That I should get going, man

It's so sad that
Andy can't get laid

+Instrumental bridge+

Later she called me
Upon leaving the party
She couldn't understand
Why possessive pussies

All think that hotties
Should be their property
And think that other guys
Threat their dating lives

They're so inscure
And so unsure that
They only ever get laid
When they're willing to pay

And that's why he told me
To leave his party, man

So when making new friends
And having fun around
Try not to talk to
The girls you think are cute

Cause you might offend
The guy who that invited them
Just like this one time when
Andy couldn't get laid
