Lyrics:

V1:

My girlfriend thinks I'm crazy, cause I think that someone’s watching me I

Don't think I'm crazy, but instead have a conspirators mind

Watch what I say, watch what I do, watch out for people like you

Who play this games in life that I believe have been rigged to loose

V2:

It's not some bullshit like there are monsters under my bed

It's bigger bullshit like the government they want us all dead

Businesses lie, then people die, our system can’t be trusted

It's why I live in my basement with 10-years of provisions

Chorus:

It doesn't matter, if everything is actually fine

Cause in my fantasy, I believe the whole world will die

And if you disagree, with my skeptic insights

I’ll keep believing, untill armageddon proves me right

V3:

Everyone tells me that, I’ve let my fears corrupt my mind

They say I look like, I haven’t been sleeping at night

Neither would you, if you thought too, the Roswell rumors were true

My eyes are bloodshot from watching TV looking for clues

Chorus:

It doesn't matter, if everything is actually fine

Cause in my fantasy, the whole world is about to die

So if you disagree, with my skeptic insights

I’ll keep believing, till armageddon proves me right

Out-tro:

It doesn’t matter, if everything is actually fine

It doesn’t matter, my reality is my mind

It doesn’t matter, I’ll believe until proven right

Everyone leave me, alone to live out my lonely life
