Verse

So many times, I met a girl

And taken my time to just confirm

She wasn't right for me

It was never that hard to see

Wasted dates, and wasted nights

Trying to impress the likes

Of the insecure and jealous types

Who even when happy want to fight

Chorus

Well can someone please

Come pinch me

As I suspect

I am dreaming

But I keep waking

With her next to me

Whoever said

That good things

Don't last

Verse

There's no point in, telling my friends

If they said what I'd say I wouldn't believe them

It's so damn easy, when we're together

Joy without pain is something I don't remember

Chorus

Well can someone please

Come pinch me

As I suspect

I am dreaming

But I keep waking

With her next to me

Whoever said

That good things

Don't last

Outro Verses 1

This could be

My first good thing

That lasts

Outro Verses 2

Yeah she could be

My first good thing

That lasts

Outro Verses 3

But there's no such thing

As something

That lasts
