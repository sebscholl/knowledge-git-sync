Verse 1:

Some people hate themselves

And learn to act like someone else

The older they get, the harder to see

The person they are underneath

Usually to late, when they come clean

Verse 2:

Eventually, you fall in love with dream

Not who someone is, but they pretended to be

For a short time, the role plays great

While they're still careful, with what they say

But sooner or later, there comes a day

Chorus:

I miss those times

Before all of your troubles were mine

How didn’t I find

Out who you really were all this time 

No one can hide

From their demons that lurk inside

Verse 3:

Then the day comes the facade breaks

And they revert back to they old ways

The love that once had consumed you

They say  was just a honeymoon

And now it's time, for the truth

Verse 4:

By this time your all confused

As they become vulnerable to you

It feels surreal this bait and switch

Who switched my baby, with this little bitch

Is this what’s love, or I'm innocent?

Chorus:

Missing times

When your troubles weren't mine

Why did you lie?

About who you are all this time

No one can ever hide

From the demons that lurk inside

Outro:

I still blame you

For hiding what was true 

About the demons that lurk in you

About the demons that lurk in you

About the demons that lurk in you

About the demons that lurk in you

About the demons that lurk in you
