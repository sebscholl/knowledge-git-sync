I never thought she'd have the thought

that things aren't right

Despite my best intentions

We can't stand each other's sight

It's the dumbest things that seem to come

Between you and I

So now paint me to be the devil

While your friends tell you you're right

Honesty is the only thing

I needed between you and I

Yet it's clear to me that you believe

There's nothing wrong with a lie

Go on and hide the truth

Then act like everything is fine

So now paint me to be the devil

While your friends tell you you're right

[ instrumental break and solo]

At the end of the rabbit hole

You think that you've found light

But it's the fires of hell

That down so deep are shining bright

It's a weakness that keeps us

Consumed in these fights

So just paint me to be the devil

While your friends tell you you're right

So just paint me to be the devil

While your friends tell you you're right
