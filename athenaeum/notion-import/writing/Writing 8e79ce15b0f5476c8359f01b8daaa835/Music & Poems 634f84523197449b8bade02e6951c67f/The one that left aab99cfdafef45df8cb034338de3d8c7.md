A, E, F#, D

Sitting in class, Dreaming of the girl

Who sat next to me, before the note got passed

that asked, if she'd be willing

To go out with a boy

Who I guess is bolder than me

I think that maybe I could have

Had things my way, if I had a clue

Of whether she'd be down, for a guy like me

And all his insecurities

[Break]

Alone at lunch, watching them two

Sit awkwardly, while he tries making a move

I like to think that, I'd do better

But never, will I get the chance to

I am a creep, I am nothing

I like to think that, I need a shrink

It helps my justify, and dramatize

My life, cause pity's, easier than pride

When the teacher called me

I'm being trained to be something I never wanted
