Chorus:

V1:

Sunset kisses the horizon

While my friends sit getting high

With me
Thankful for interaction

I've been needing a distraction 

From things, to dream
V2:

Even when we're at our bestDeath's always a looming dreadWhose, hovering
Slow exhale a cloud of smokeFall right down onto the coastIn that moment, I'm king
Chorus:Maybe one day We'll share our storiesWith friends we stillHave left
No-one ever knowsWhen lives will endLove them whileYou can
Bridge :I'm lost in timeI've lost my mindThere so much fearPent up inside 
These cheap escapes Are attempts to break The need to faceWhat I can't face
So I hideI hideI hide
Chorus:Maybe one day We'll share our storiesWith friends we stillHave left
No-one ever knowsWhen lives will endLove them whileYou can
