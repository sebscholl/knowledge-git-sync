I'll never understand how so many people

Are do comfortable fitting a mold

I like the people the people

Some believe are evil

I like the ones who rock the boat

A million wishes and a million kisses

All of them wasted on you

And maybe baby if I

Blew a litte hard

I could send you on sailing right through

Yeah sailing on through
