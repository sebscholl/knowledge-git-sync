Hey there Dahlila

what's it like in new York City

I'm 1000 miles away and girl

Tonight you look so pretty

yes you do

I snuck a camera in your room

To livestream you

Hey there, Delilah

Don't you worry about the distance

I'm right there if you get lonely

Give this song another listen

Close your eyes

Look out your window there's a surprise

I'm there outstand

Oh, it's what you do to me

Oh, I wish you would do me

Oh, I swear I'm not a creep

Oh, please don't call the police

Don't call the police, oh oh

Hey there, Delilah

I know times are gettin' hard

But just believe me, girl

Someday you'll forget I locked you in my car

To prove to you

My love is unfaulteringly true

My heart's for you

Hey there, Delilah

I've got so much left to say

Every simple song I wrote to you

The other prisoners took it away

I wish you'd call

Even more in love with you I'd fall

You're face is scratched on my cell wall

Oh, it's what you do to me

Oh, it's what you do to me

Oh, it's what you do to me

Oh, it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far

But they've got planes and trains and cars

I'd walk to you if I had no other way

But thank God that there's trains and cars

Cause on second thought that's fucking far

After after my escape I can not board a plane

And you're to blame

Hey there, Delilah

You be good, and don't you miss me

Two more years and you'll be done with school

And I'll be out of prison

You know it's all because of you

We can do whatever we want to

Hey there, Delilah, here's to you

I will find you

Oh, it's what you do to me

Oh, I wish you would do me

Oh, please don't call the police

Oh, why can't you just love me?

What can't you live my? woah, woah

Oh woah, oh

Oh
