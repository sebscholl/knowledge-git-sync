Verse
C E A F

Bridge
A F C G

Chorus
C G A F
A    G

V1:
You know I have some, PTSD
And don't even know, all of my stories
I can't say I have, had the best time
When I reflect back, on my love life

V2:
I once was just a, nother nice guy
Who idealized the, girls that he liked
Always excusing, the ways they treated me
Expect of them tyranny, while myself chivalry

Bridge:
Now to say I'm jaded, would be polite
But since we've been together, I've realized

Chorus:
I've been loved before, but never like this
I've been loved before, but it felt amiss
Cause the more I gave the less I got
The more I shared the more she fought
You've made me feel like I've been saved

Your loves changing the way, I see things

V3:
It's not so simple, to change my mind
On things I've learned, from living my life
Everyone has scars, from anothers defeat
Affecting the ways they, let their own heart speak

V4:
I told myself I wouldn't, be here again
Spending time with a girl, (beyond a one night stand OR for anything but sex)
But the way you are, has opened my eyes
To see what it means, to be treated right

Bridge:
It might sound naive, but I don't mind
In the time I've been with you, I have realized

Chorus:
I've been loved before, but never like this
I've been loved before, but it felt amiss
Cause the more I gave the less I got
More I shared the more she fought
With you I feel like I've been saved

Your loves changing the way, I see things

Solo:

Bridge:
I told myself I wouldn't, be here again
Spending time with a girl,  for anything but sex
But the way you are, has opened my eyes
To see what it means, to be treated right

The happiness you've, brought into my life
Has knocked down the walls I built inside

Chorus:
I've been loved before, but never like this
I've been loved before, but it felt amiss
Cause the more I gave the less I got
More I shared the more she thought
With you I feel like I've been saved

Your loves changing the way, I see things
