## These are ideas for verses or choruses of songs.

---

Say, that my odds aren't favoring

That I should wake up from

Good memory isn't always a good thing.

---

Verse: where have all the rock stars gone

---

Chorus: I could use some therapy, and you could use some oversight

---

I watch the ice melt in my whiskey glass

Bringing my drink down to less and less

---

She said, take a deep breath and ease your mind

you're thinking too hard of reasons why

What we have might be for life

---

Cause what good are promises if all you do is lie

---

Cause everybody is useless

When their time comes

G E C B

Well she cried again, because she tried again

To make something of something, that was built on nothing.

I even told her not to,

---

I know that it may sound absurd

But the older I get the more I've learned

oh, how it feels to be lonely

It's that there's no body to find

But the girls I meet all don't feel right

And so I'm signing lonely

---

She says if she could go back

It would be to Paris

In the 1920s because

She preferred the way men dressed

I know I'm nothing special, but

Oh God knows how I've tried

Yet she still lives in her dreams

Where romantics remain a pastime

She's always wants something

That she's never had

I guess that's how we feel

When we look

---

I don't really know you 

But I think I should show you

That the person who you love

They just try to control you

But you've got to let me in 

If we're going to begin

Helping you get saved
