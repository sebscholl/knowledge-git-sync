Lyrics:

V1: Juliette, c'mon and let me through

The window, pane that's just another shield you use

I can see, that you are trying to protect yourself

From all the things, that that boy did who ended your fairy tale

Bridge: But if, you stay, hiding that way

I won't, get the chance, to say

Chorus 1: Let's ride down, on a train to the sea shore

Adopt a dog and, take it to play in the park

Will you please hold me so I don't scream, when we watch your favorite horror movies

Let's go sillily, seeing if we could be something

V2: Juliette, people never come at a time

At which we, are ready for them to become a part of our lives

It's frightening, to let yourself fall for someone else

Especially, when the last time dragged your heart though hell

Bridge: But if, you stay, hiding that way

I won't, get the chance, to say

Chorus 2: How about we buy some wine, and get drunk on a roof top

We could go skinny dip, in a stranger's pool

Will you please come keep me company, at a strange worked related cocktailâ€‹ thing

Let's go sillily, seeing if we could be something

Interlude: There's not enough, people in the world like us

Few and far between, friends and lovers like these

Take my hand, close your eyes and on the count of three

Chorus 3: We order, Chinese and watch TV all evening

We book two tickets, and go spend a week on a beach

Cause I don't really know you, and you don't really know me

Which means there's still room, for discovery

So let's go sillily, seeing if we could be something
