Verse

Feeling like I'm in space.

With a smile on my face.

Somebody leave me in this place.

My mind feels no worries.

Sensing life's glory.

It seems to good of a story.

Chorus

Golden X2

Verse

Like a fish in the deep blue abyss.

Seeing you brings thoughts of bliss.

Your love is what keeps me together.

For the worse or for the better. (Distantly singing ya ya ya ya)

Chorus

Golden X2

Bridge (intense chaotic build up)

My mindâ€™s not thinking right.

Common sense is nowhere in sight.

Cause I'm feeling so free.

As free as I will ever be.

Somebody leave me in this place.

Just leave me in this place.
