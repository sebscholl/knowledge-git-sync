She's

The kind of girl I'm going for

Things

Things will have her at me door

She's

The materialistic type

Please

Wait till I can afford to satisfy

I'm going to make that girl mine

Jeans

Those new ones from that magazine

Bling

So iced out I'm hard to see

Maxed

Out all of my credit cards

Hope

I don't look like I'm trying to hard

I think she caught me staring

Yet when I see her there

With all those other guys

That to me look in drag

With their GQ hairstyles

I sit back and I wonder why

I spent all of my money

On these clothes that are too tight

Mirrors are making me think I'm

Losing my mind

Lips

Red enough to stop a car

Heels

Leopard print and 6" tall

Stepping

Out of some guys limosine 

Velvet

Ropes start lifting

And she walks right past me

Another club strip queen

Chorus repeat
