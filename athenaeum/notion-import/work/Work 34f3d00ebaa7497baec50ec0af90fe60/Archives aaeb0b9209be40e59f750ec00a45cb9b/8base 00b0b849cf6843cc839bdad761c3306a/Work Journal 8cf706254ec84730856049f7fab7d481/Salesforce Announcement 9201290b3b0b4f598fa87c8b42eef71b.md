Hey {{ first_name }}, how's it going?

Several months ago you may have overheard 8base talking about it's Salesforce integration. Something about a way to build apps that use Salesforce data with an 8base backend? What?

Well, as of last week the full vision of those conversations came to fruition. While many people have been tinkering in 8base with our beta Salesforce Bolt integration since December 2019, the full *Read / Write* integration is now ready to be used in production applications. What does that mean?

Business data usually exists across many different systems. One of the most popular systems is Salesforce. That said, **systems that are easy to get data into aren't always easy to get data out of.** Sometimes it's a poorly designed API, gated ecosystem, or even simply a lack of data access features. Developers often find themselves vexed when trying to programmatically access critical data stored across different systems.

With the full release of 8base's Salesforce Bolt integration, we've trivialized access and management of ones Salesforce data through our GraphQL API. This means that individuals and companies building custom applications can have **full access to their Salesforce and 8base data through a single API endpoint.** This is opens up a plethora of new business application opportunities that, traditionally, would have been too expensive to develop and maintain.

If you're interested in using the integration in your own development effort, we'd love to talk! Let us know and we'll schedule some time to discuss what you're building and how we can help bring the vision into reality.

Thank you

8base Team

Many of the enterprise apps that developers build require an ability to integrate with other systems and applications used within an organization. Such integrations can occur at every layer of an application, depending on the concept being developed. This aids in enterprises accomplishing a significantly higher lever of consistency in their software systems, in relation to both data and quality.

One of the most popular software systems used in business today is Salesforce.com. That said, **systems that are easy to get data into aren't always easy to get data out of.** Sometimes a poorly designed API, gated ecosystem, or simple lack of data access features causes significant friction during the development and ongoing-maintenance of integrated apps. Developers often find themselves vexed when trying to programmatically access critical data stored across different systems.

With the release of 8base's Salesforce Bolt integration, we've trivialized access and management to ones Salesforce data through our GraphQL API. This means that individuals and companies building custom applications can have **full access to their Salesforce and 8base data through a single API endpoint.** 

This is opens up a plethora of new business application opportunities that, traditionally, would have required varied expertise and large budgets to develop and maintain. Whether it's a custom salesperson portal with built-in contract workflows, an SaaS application with the customer record stored in Salesforce, or anything else, all it takes is a few clicks to install and configure the seamless integration.

Additionally, a key feature of the Salesforce Bolt integration is the ability to not only access and manage your Salesforce data through the GraphQL API, but build relationships between tables in 8base and Salesforce. What does this mean? Let's imagine that you're building an custom Invoicing System. All your customer data is stored in Salesforce while the invoice records are being stored in an 8base table. Even though the data is stored in separate systems, a relationship can be established so that Invoices belong to Customers. This eliminates both
