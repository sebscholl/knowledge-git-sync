Documentation V2

**Target Finish: Oct. 31st**

# OVERVIEW

In launching 8base’s sales and marketing efforts, it is crucial that we totally revamp our customer facing documentation resources. As part of that effort, will we need to define the new resources that will be utilized to track, render, and host our documentation. Additionally, we will need to define specifications around best practices and guidelines. Ensuring that all content published is rich in information and effective in communicating its’ value.

# GOALS

1. Identify, acquire, and launch a new 8base documentation and tutorials service
2. Update and migrate all current documentation articles from the READme.io platform
3. Enrich documentation archives with a complete fundamental and intermediate 8base knowledge
4. Develop a tutorials application that allows for long format tutorials to be developed and hosted
5. Launch the 8base Academy YouTube Channel with a 2-videos per week cadence

# IMPLEMENTATION AND TOOLS

### 

### 8base Academy Videos:

The 8base Academy videos will be recorded in the Miami Office, and feature either Sebastian or another relevant 8base Team Member based on the topic being discussed. The length of these videos will run anywhere from 30-seconds to 5-minutes, and focus on “bite-sized” knowledge and concepts of 8base.

For as many sections as possible in the 8base Documentation, 8base should have produced a video demonstrating the functionality being accomplished through a screen share demonstration. Such videos will be published on both YouTube under an "8Base Academy" channel, as well as at the top of any relevant documentation section (with YouTube embed).

Good Video Subject

* 8base Platform: Course 11: Creating Many-to-Many Relationships

Bad Video Subject

* 8Base Platform: Course 11: Building a To-do App with React.js + 8Base

### 8base Tutorials:

Tutorials in 8base will be treated starkly different from documentation. From a high level, documentation is instruction while tutorials are implementation. This allows us to support tutorials being written for a number of different application concepts, third-party development tools, and frameworks, while maintaining the integrity of the 8base documentation.

8base’s tutorials will be hosted in a subfolder of the [www.8base.com](http://www.8base.com/) domain at the /tutorials path. This will allow for improved SEO optimization by enriching the 8base.com content library, as well as leveraging off back links to the tutorials from different outlets sharing the links.

An important role that tutorials will play in 8base’s content strategy is that they will act as a backbone for blog articles. For example, once a comprehensive tutorial is created on 8base for a project - like, “Building a full featured messaging app” - we then have the ability to hire or encourage bloggers to use that tutorial, develop their own messaging app using a framework of choice, and blog about the experience.

Good Tutorial Subject

* 8base Tutorial: How to create a fully featured Messaging App using 8base

Bad Tutorial Subject

* 8base Tutorial: How to set and update Permissions in 8base

### 8base Documentation:

The 8base documentation is going to be the key resource in enabling people to quickly become 8base experts. Therefore, it needs to be clear, crisp, contributable, and easily managed. In setting up a new documentation service, 8base will use a tool that leverages Git to manage the documentation content.

A server located at the subdomain [docs.8base.com](http://docs.8base.com/) will be set up, which can be easily accessed from a “Documentation” located in the 8base.com footer section. It is important that we maintain as much flexibility as possible in the tools we choose to maintain our documentation, while adding as little tech debt / overhead as possible in the process.
