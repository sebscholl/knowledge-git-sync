# principles triumph techniques

*"Principles are higher than techniques. Principles produce techniques in an instant."*

Throughout our lives, we are misled to believe that **technique** is what leads to excellence. While there are few substitutes for technique, **principles** are their predecessors. With principles, techniques flow naturally and become obvious. Having a technique without principles is akin to performing sea navigation without the stars.
