# Metric Test Driven Development (MTDD)

In any startup's early life cycle, it can be tempting to move fast and break things. However, doing so without putting the measurement tools in place to ensure:

1) Everyone is working towards a common goal.
2) Everyone can measure the impact of their efforts.

It is a sure way to result in frustration, misalignment, and high chances of failure. To this purpose, Metric Test Driven Development is the idea that **Metrics** come first, as understanding the way a product or feature will get measured should be a primary input into the requirements for developing the product.
