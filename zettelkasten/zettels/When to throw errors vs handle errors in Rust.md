# When to throw errors vs handle errors in Rust

It's interesting to see in Rust how the language is structured around making you a more thoughtful programmer. An example of this is seen in the way Errors are treated. Your code must consider error handling explicitly, or it won't compile. As a result, the structures of the language become rich in their way of expressing and handling all plausible scenarios.
