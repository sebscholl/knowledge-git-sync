# workflow for creating maps of content (MOPs)

The idea behind [[using of ghost notes instead of tags]] is that cluster identification allows for you to then go about building Map of Contents MOPs retrospectively as opposed to proactively. 

This is a much-preferred workflow because we're never entirely sure how connections build over time ([[differentiation between connection and collection in Zettelkasten]]) around disconnected ideas.  However, as such patterns become clear, we can retrospectively add context and formality to a cluster.
