# Unless it's practice, do not do the same thing twice

While working today, I realized that all of the labor I'm currently doing for 8base is repetitive tasks. It is not only demotivating but also a form of regression to continuously perform a responsibility or workflow that does not demand conscious thought and effort. 

Therefore always work to automate, and turn yourself into a manager of tasks. Whether or not the workforce is digital or human.
