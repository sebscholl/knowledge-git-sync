# All databases are the same

It's easy to get enamored with new technologies, but rarely is a new innovation truly being applied. A good example of this is databases. Relational, Non-relational, graph databases, while these may seem like all new technologies, they are all new implementations of the same technology but differ by external structure. Essentially a software that persists data by writing it to a disk. All that these new implementations do is better address different problem domains by reducing the number of I/O operations required to perform a write or query.
